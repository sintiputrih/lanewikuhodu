Interestingly, it still beats the mind how Watson’s weight does not really make her look very slender as she is actually curvy.</p><p>To maintain such a good figure, you definitely cannot eat wrong and for Emma Watson, eating right and healthy is top on her list. She has a high preference for fresh veggies, lean meat, as well as protein and healthy snack choices. However, she definitely indulges in her cravings on rare occasions but does not make a habit of eating junk food all the time.</p><p>A typical breakfast combo for the British film star would certainly include a high protein dish. Watson believes that this will help keep her energy high for the rest of the day.</p><p>For lunch, Emma would also go for whole grains; fresh veggies, alongside any source of lean protein. Dinner will also contain most of the things she had as lunch but she might decide to spice things up with a glass of mojitos if she is hanging out with friends.</p><p>While most people would easily consume any snack they can lay their hands on which would mean making unhealthy choices, Emma Watson is pretty conscious about her snacks. To stay in a safe zone, she prefers to take a cup of tea or water to hydrate.</p><h3><strong>Emma Watson’s Top-rated Fitness Regime & Beauty Routine</strong></h3><p>The British actress has proved to be resilient in her quest for that perfect look and keeping up with an intense workout routine has helped her achieve her goal. Emma’s training sessions usually last for about 30 minutes and she fills this time by doing cardio, pilates, sprints, weight lifting and a couple of other workout routines to improve her strength and balance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Emma-Watson-2.jpg><p>Emma, who is also a yoga instructor, includes it in her fitness regime to help build her body. More so, the actress ensures that her daily workouts are planned in such a way that she looks forward to breaking the sweat at the gym or with a personal trainer.</p><p>For her beauty routine, the actress is known for her rule to have her baths as often as possible in a day. Emma went on to reveal that having 3 baths a day is not even too much for her. She also makes it a rule to wash her face properly before going to bed no matter how tired she feels. Some of her favourite beauty products include Epsom oils and salts, French Girl Organics body products, as well Lola’s Apothecary Queen of Roses milk bath.</p><h2><strong>How Tall Is The Harry Potter Star?</strong></h2><p>Just by looking at Emma Watson, you can tell that she is not on the tall side but you can’t deny the fact that the star has reached a height where she is comfortable. <strong>Emma stands at 5 feet 5 inches in height</strong> and if she isn’t happy with her height, there is someone out there who appreciates it and his name is Daniel Radcliffe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Emma-Watson-after-working-out.jpg><p>Yes, initially, he was concerned that his Harry Potter co-stars would have major growth spurts and leave him behind, but his fears were placated when they all remained roughly the same height. All except for Ron towards the end of the saga. Daniel’s fears were laid to rest when he eventually fell within the same height range as Emma Watson and Rupert.<br>Other celebrities who share Emma Watson’s height include the likes of Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus, Demi Moore, Lindsey Lohan and Nicole Scherzinger who all stand as tall as the star.</p><h3><strong>Your Questions Answered:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Mexican food, Nutella on strawberries, Blueberry-ricotta Pancakes</li><li><strong>Favorite Singer:</strong> Rihanna, Kings of Leon, Joni Mitchell</li><li><strong>Favorite Brands:</strong> Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Chanel, Burberry, Givenchy</li><li><strong>Favorite Books:</strong> Mom & Me & Mom by Maya Angelou, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by J.K.
