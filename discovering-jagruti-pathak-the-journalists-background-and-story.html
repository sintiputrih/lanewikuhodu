Following the success of Scam 1992: The Harshad Mehta Story, renowned filmmaker Hansal Mehta presents another compelling narrative of crime, ambition, and law enforcement in the form of Scoop. This time, the narrative revolves around the notorious Chhota Rajan, an underground mafia figure, promising a thrilling crime drama on Netflix.</p><p>The Scoop trailer introduces Jagruti Pathak (portrayed by Karishma Tanna), an ambitious reporter who catches the attention of the audience. Her male colleagues refer to her three promotions in seven years, insinuating biased justifications for her success. As the prime suspect in the murder of a senior journalist, this becomes a defining aspect of her character.</p><h2>The Enigma of Jagruti Pathak: Age and Wikipedia</h2><p><strong>Jagruti Pathak</strong>‘s official Wikipedia page is yet to be established and her age remains undisclosed to the media and the public. Her role as a celebrity crime reporter and the lead suspect in another journalist’s death forms the crux of the narrative in the upcoming Netflix series Scoop, helmed by Hansal Metha and Mrummayee Lagoo Waikul.</p><p>Karishma Tanna, a prominent Indian actress, embodies the character of Jagruti Pathak. Unlike Jagruti, Karishma has a dedicated Wikipedia page. Born on December 21, 1983, Karishma’s established age makes it plausible to assume Jagruti was in her early forties at the time of the incident. However, this assumption lacks credible substantiation. The Scoop trailer presents Jagruti as the deputy bureau head of a newspaper and orchestrating an interview with Nana, a prominent figure within Chhota Rajan’s gang.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jagruti-Pathak-1.jpg alt="Jagruti Pathak" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Her credibility is shattered when even her most trusted sources turn against her following the brutal killing of Jaideb Sen (played by Prosenjit Chatterjee), leading to her arrest as the prime suspect. Jagruti fights to salvage her reputation while her family unwaveringly supports her throughout.</p><h2>Exploring Jagruti Pathak’s Family and Background</h2><p>The identity of Jagruti Pathak’s family remains undisclosed to the media and the public. However, she resided in India with her parents, as depicted in the Scoop trailer, which portrays the poignant moments of Jagruti striving for justice alongside her dedicated parents amid the ruthless impact on her professional standing.</p><p>Meanwhile, the series draws inspiration from journalist Jigna Vora’s book, “Behind Bars in Byculla: My Days in Prison,” chronicling the events surrounding the death of journalist Jyotirmoy Dey in 2011. Karishma Tanna, portraying Jagruti, hails from the Indian state of Maharashtra, with her formative years spent in Bombay. She is the devoted daughter of her late father, Kartik Tanna, and maintains a close bond with her mother, following her father’s passing in October 2012.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/newsnownigeria.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jagruti-Pathak-2.jpg alt="Jagruti Pathak" width=400 height=400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Jagruti Pathak’s Financial Standing: Unraveling Her Earnings</h2><p>As of August 2023, Jagruti Pathak’s net worth remains undisclosed. Her primary source of income stemmed from her journalistic endeavors, although the relatively modest earnings of journalists in India may indicate a modest net worth. Despite this, she evidently led a content life.</p><p>On the other hand, Karishma Tanna, who embodies Jagruti, is speculated to possess a net worth of $5 million as of August 20, 2023, earning over 30 lakhs of Indian rupees monthly, with reported demands of 1.5 lakhs IC per episode.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiboquTpMOmvsinnmaikZy%2FtsDIZqearJiWuG7Ax55ko6elp7uiuMisq6xlkpawrLPRqKynnF2Wu6V50q2mq7Ff</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
