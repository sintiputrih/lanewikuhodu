They say that lightning never strikes the same place twice, but the opposite seems to be true for celebrity siblings.</p><p>Famous brothers and sisters appear to have star power running in their genes including&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kate</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Oliver Hudson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cara</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Poppy Delevingne</strong></a> and the Baldwin brothers. Born to the same parents, these relatives not only followed similar life paths, pursuing careers in acting, music, sports and reality TV, but made names for themselves apart from their famous family members.</p><p>Kate and Oliver, who share parents <a href=#><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a> and ex <a href=#><strong>Bill Hudson</strong></a>, have opened up about <a href=#>having a strong sibling bond despite the occasional</a> squabble.</p><p>“We have different ideas [about parenting],” the Scream Queens alum — who shares t<a href=#>hree kids with wife <strong>Erinn Bartlett</strong> </a>exclusively told Us Weekly in March 2021. “There’s a core for sure of just wanting our kids to be good human beings, be polite and understand that they’re very lucky people to be born into the sort of family we’re born into … but it’s sort of the way that we go about doing things. What we let our kids watch, the freedoms we allow them. We’re different in that way.”</p><p>Oliver previously gushed <a href=#>about being a “cool uncle” to Kate and half-brother</a> <strong>Wyatt Russell</strong>‘s kids. (The Glass Onion star shares son Ryder with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Chris Robinson</strong></a>, son Bingham with ex-fiancé<a href=#><strong> Matt Bellamy</strong></a> and daughter Rani Rose with fiancé <a href=#><strong>Danny Fujikawa</strong></a>. Wyatt, for his part, <a href=#>shares son Buddy with wife <strong>Meredith Hagner</strong></a>.)</p><p>“I let my kids watch movies that I probably shouldn’t, so when Kate’s kids come to my house, I’m sure they’re pretty excited because I let them watch things that Kate will not let them watch,” Oliver joked to Us in November 2018. “[It’s] worth the risk. You need an uncle that’s gonna let them do things. That’s the point of being a cool uncle!”</p><p>Things can also get competitive for some celebrity siblings.&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a>, for instance, has been <a href=#>forced to compete </a>against big sister <a href=#><strong>Venus Williams</strong></a> for a Grand Slam title. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kate</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rooney Mara</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Dakota</strong> </a>and<a href=#> <strong>Elle Fanning</strong></a>, have gone against one another for the same movie parts.</p><p>“I know conflict is more interesting,” Rooney told The Guardian in 2016 about being in the same industry as her sister. “But honestly, I just feel so grateful that we’re both living our dreams successfully and to be able to share that with someone you grew up with — it’s really special.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Through it all, however, these family members seem to have each other’s backs when it matters most.</p><p>Scroll through to learn more about some of our favorite star siblings:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJtkrKGSobavs9JmaWlpY2Z9eHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
