While it is wonderful that so many people have been entertained by those films, it is unfortunate that many youngsters have an unrealistic view of teen romance because of them. After all, just like most teen romances will never have to deal with a terminal disease diagnosis, the majority of young couples aren’t meant to remain together forever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, there are a lot of reasons why most teen relationships involving celebrities aren’t destined to last, including the immaturity of the people involved. On top of that, even though some <a href=#>celebrity couples who began dating early in life have stuck together</a>, that is the exception to the rule. After all, the odds are against any stars who begin dating when they are young since they have to overcome obstacles that are a lot more intense than anything regular teen couples have to cope with. For proof of that fact, all you have to do is take a look at Britt Robertson and Dylan O’Brien’s relationship since hackers seemed to delight in messing with the two young stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus & Nick Jonas + Other Young Celebrity Couples We Totally Forgot About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-couple-rsquo-s-time-together>The Couple’s Time Together</h2><p>Most of the time when two stars get together when they are in their early-20s, their time as a couple is extremely short-lived. When it comes to Britt Robertson and Dylan O’Brien’s relationship, however, the couple stayed together for many years.</p><p>After meeting while working together on the film The First Time, Britt Robertson and Dylan O’Brien gradually grew closer together. In fact, when O’Brien and Robertson filmed a scene in which their characters kissed, things were so awkward that the sequence had to be reshot the following day. Despite that initial misstep, the two young actors quickly developed chemistry which is obvious to anyone who watches The First Time. With that in mind, it isn’t surprising that Robertson and O’Brien eventually fell in love which Dylan commented on in a 2015 tweet in which he professed having a crush on Britt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, it was reported that Robertson and O’Brien had gone their separate ways in 2018. Unsurprisingly, rumors swirled that other people had come between O’Brien and Robertson but the validity of those claims are unconfirmed. However, what is known is that hackers impacted Robertson and O’Brien’s lives and relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Dylan O’Brien Broke Up With Girlfriend Britt Robertson</a></span></p><h2 id=dylan-o-rsquo-brien-rsquo-s-photo-leak>Dylan O’Brien’s Photo Leak</h2><p>If anyone had someone hack into their account and post several of their photos online, they would be mortified and traumatized even if the images were entirely PG. With that in mind, everyone should instinctively know how wrong it is whenever a celebrity has their unclothed images leaked online. Despite that, far too <a href=#>many stars have had their private photos leaked online including Jennifer Lawrence</a> and several others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intimate images of Dylan O’Brien were leaked online</a> during the final months of his relationship with Britt Robertson and again in November 2021 after the release of <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>'s "All Too Well" video. To say this is disgusting is a huge understatement, to say the least. Of course, O’Brien must have felt especially violated in that situation but it also has to be noted that Robertson must have been extremely upset as well. After all, everyone should be able to understand how distressing it would be to have their significant other’s private photos leaked without their consent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Nude Photos Of Calvin Harris Were Leaked Online, And Social Media Is Blowing Up!</a></span></p><h2 id=britt-robertson-rsquo-s-hacked-account-and-engagement-announcement>Britt Robertson’s Hacked Account And Engagement Announcement</h2><p>Over the last couple of decades, it has become increasingly common for notable celebrities to interact with their fans on social media. On the bright side, it is great that stars can build a relationship with their fans while still keeping up a wall separating the two groups. However, there is a dark side of stars going on social media since there are some hackers who obviously are attracted to the idea of breaking into the accounts of the rich and famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, in 2017 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britt Robertson had one of her accounts hacked</a>. In June of 2017, Robertson’s fans went on Instagram and saw an image of Dylan O’Brien which was accompanied by an eye-popping caption. "Yes, we are officially engaged. #Brylan is real confirmed by Chikri." Even though some fans of the couple immediately found the post suspicious given the reference to an unknown person known as Chikri, lots of observers took it at face value. With that in mind, it seems very possible that people who knew Robertson and O’Brien personally bought into the fake engagement announcement. On top of that, even if nobody the couple had a relationship with was tricked by the post, O’Brien and Robertson must have felt like they were being messed with.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Really Happened To Dylan O'Brien's Ex-Girlfriend, Britt Robertson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsqSRo3qwrtGinKdlkaOxbq7RoqutZaKkr6a%2B06ymp2WimrmiwMiopaygmaV6rbHApGSsm5GjsaK4jKGYnKOVmXqotdGlnauhlaOxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
