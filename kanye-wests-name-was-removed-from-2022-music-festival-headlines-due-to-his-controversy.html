This is absurd that he is permitted to do so freely.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>KANYE WEST WITH SAINT AT THE WARRIORS CELTICS BASKETBALL GAME IN SAN FRANCISCO TONIGHT <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mCmGZvOE4L</a></p><p>— YEEZY GOD (@gunnertierno) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">March 17, 2022</a></p><p>The petition was launched on the same day that Instagram suspended West, 44, for 24 hours for continuously attacking Kardashian, 41, and Davidson, 28, as well as comedians D.L. Hughley and Trevor Noah.&nbsp;The petition on Change.org presently has 5,118 supporters.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kanye-West-2.jpg alt="Kanye West" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What is Kanye West’s relationship with Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson?</h2><p>West has accused Kardashian of using her four children to antagonize and gaslight him, citing daughter North’s usage of TikTok, and said that he had become more estranged from his family. He’s also been cyberbullied for weeks, decapitating a cartoon portrayal of Davidson in his new music video, Eazy.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pete-Davidson.jpg alt="Pete Davidson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rather than caving into West’s demands, Kardashian has pledged to take the “high road” in their pending divorce. Despite having formally separated in March 2022, the ex-couple is still wrangling over child custody and property concerns. Kardashian was seen in a sneak peek film published on YouTube by The Ellen Show, speaking with presenter Ellen DeGeneres on the next show, which will run on April 13. When DeGeneres inquired as to why Kim has always been protective of Kanye West despite the rapper’s continual abuse, the SKIMS founder responded:</p><p>“I’m always going to be protective. I’ve always wanted my children to see only the finest. As difficult as it might be at times, I strive to ignore it and do what is best for the children.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kim-Kardashian-4.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>She continued by praising her mother, Kris Jenner, and ex-husband and late father of the Kardashians, Robert Kardashian, for providing a positive example for her. Additionally, the social media sensation said that regardless of what happens, Kanye is the father of her children. Coachella 2022 will take place in Indio, California, between April 15, 2022, and April 17, 2022, and again between April 22, 2022, and April 24, 2022. Kanye West, Harry Styles, and Billie Eilish will headline.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimqapmnq4sdKtqmamkaKybsPArGSrnZ2kw6awjJ%2BpqKVdZ31zfoymrKyhk2Kzpr%2FToq2apF2dsqKwy6KlnqtdmcKmedOoZKGho2KwsLrTq6avnaKoxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
