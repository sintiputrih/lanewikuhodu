He scored his first international goal on May 22, 2016, in a friendly against Puerto Rico at the Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.</p><p>Ahead of the 2015–16 season, Ream was linked with a move to Championship rivals Queens Park Rangers, who made a bid for him. However, the bid was rejected.</p><p>On August 20, 2015, Ream was sold to Fulham, with whom he signed a four-year contract. The move was undisclosed fee and has an option to extend his stay by a further year.</p><p>He made his Fulham debut on August 29, 2015, in a 3–1 win over Rotherham United, playing 90 minutes. He made 29 appearances for the club in his first season, partly due to international commitment and injuries. After initially playing as a center back, he was used at left back towards the end of the season, following the departure of <a href=#>James Husband</a>. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 loss against Queens Park Rangers on October 1, 2016.</p><p>Ahead of the 2014–15 season, on July 6, 2014, Ream signed a new three-year contract with Bolton that lasts until the summer of 2017. Over the course of the season, he made a total of 44 appearances, missing two matches, one as an unused substitute against Derby County on September 27, 2014 and one through injury. For the second season in a row, he was named as Bolton's player of the year.</p><p>Ahead of the 2013–14 season, Ream was linked with a move to Middlesbrough, a move that was denied by the club and Ream. After appearing the first three matches as an unused substitute, he started as defensive midfielder for four matches in September. In early February 2014, he was forced to wear a protective mask in Wanderers games after a collision with Queens Park Rangers striker <a href=#>Charlie Austin</a>. Throughout the 2013–14 season, Ream played at left back and center back, where he established his partnership with <a href=#>Matt Mills</a> and redeemed himself in the first team making 42 appearances. At the end of that season, he was voted the fans' player of the year and the club’s player of the year.</p><p>After a two-year absence, Ream was again called into the U.S. national team in 2013 appearing as an unused substitute against Bosnia and Herzegovina on August 14, 2013. On September 3, 2014, he played his first international match in three years, playing 45 minutes in a 1–0 win over Czech Republic.</p><p>Bolton completed the signing of Ream on January 26, 2012, on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

Twenty-four hours after getting married Ream canceled his honeymoon planned in Tahiti to undergo a move to Bolton Wanderers. Ream later stated in The Bolton News interview that he still made a right choice in canceling his honeymoon.</p><p>During Ream's second season in New York, he played and started in 28 of 34 matches during the regular season; he missed 6 matches largely due to international call-ups during the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup.</p><p>In December 2011, during the MLS off-season, Ream spent a short time training with both West Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers with permission from the Red Bulls to maintain his fitness during the winter break. At the beginning of January 2012, Bolton made a transfer offer of £2.5m for him. The bid was accepted and after personal terms were agreed he received a work permit on January 24.</p><p>Ream started in their first game of the 2011 Gold Cup, a 2–0 win over Canada.
