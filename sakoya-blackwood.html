In 2022, Sakoya was arrested after she started blackmailing AMC’s CEO Adam Aron.</p><p>In March 2022, a woman named Blackwood started a deceptive scheme by texting AMC’s Adam Aron. Posing as a 17-year-old ballet dancer through fake pictures of a Russian model, she misled Aron, who believed she was someone from his past. Their messages escalated, and Aron ended up sharing explicit photos, including ones with another woman.</p><p>Blackwood invented fake characters, masquerading as an ex-boyfriend and a Vanity Fair reporter, claiming they had seen the messages. She demanded money to keep the matter hidden, threatening to expose the explicit content to the media and AMC’s board. Aron, however, stood strong and reported the blackmail to the FBI.</p><p>Subsequently, the FBI swiftly acted, leading to the arrest of Sakoya Blackwood on August 31, 2023. The court proceedings unveiled Blackwood’s use of multiple false online identities to deceive and extort wealthy individuals.</p><p>These days this case is being talked about because Aron posted a tweet on his Twitter handle explaining what happened to him and how he was targeted and blackmailed.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Adam Aron wife Abbe Kahn" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Adam-Aron-wife-Abbe-Kahn.webp alt="Adam Aron wife Abbe Kahn" width=400 height=401 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>How did Sakoya Set a Trap For Adam Aron?</strong></h2><p>This all started in March 2022 when Sakoya Blackwood sent text messages to AMC’s Adam Aron. This person, from the Bronx, sent pictures of a Russian model and lied, saying she was a 17-year-old ballet dancer. Aron, who is married, thought she was someone he had been with before.</p><p>They started messaging each other, and Aron ended up sending some explicit pictures, including ones with him and another woman. Later, Blackwood made up fake characters and continued texting Aron using different names online, like a fake ex-boyfriend and a made-up Vanity Fair reporter.</p><p>She pretended these characters had seen some of the messages. Blackwood asked Aron for a lot of money to keep things secret. She also threatened to show the explicit pictures and messages to the media and AMC’s board.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Court documents related to Adam Aron phishing scam" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Court-documents-related-to-Adam-Aron-phishing-scam.webp alt="Court documents related to Adam Aron phishing scam" width=400 height=478 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Investigation and Trial</strong></h2><p>Aron stayed strong and didn’t give in to the blackmail. He told the FBI about what happened. On October 12, 2023, the CEO shared this on Twitter, saying how important it is for people with power to stand up against blackmail.</p><p>After Aron told the FBI, they quickly started looking into it and found the person responsible, Sakoya Blackwood. She was arrested on August 31, 2023. They took her to court in Manhattan, where Judge Jennifer Willis and Judge Jesse M. Furman oversaw the case.</p><p>In court, they discovered that Blackwood used fake identities online to trick rich and famous people and get money from them. She made a deal with the court to avoid a long 27-year sentence. Instead, she got credit for the time she had already spent in jail, which ended in July.</p><p>That added up to a little over ten months in jail. She also has to be supervised for three years as part of the deal, for tricking people online and threatening them, which was explained by the government officials.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Israeli Billionaire Idan Ofer Wiki, Age, Wife, Kids, Net Worth and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Fake ID cards found at Sakoya Blackwood's home" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Fake-ID-cards-found-at-Sakoya-Blackwoods-home.webp alt="Fake ID cards found at Sakoya Blackwood's home" width=400 height=488 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>What Do We Know About Sakoya Blackwood?</strong></h2><p>In 1988 Sakoya Blackwood (age 35) was born in an African-American family in New York, United States.
