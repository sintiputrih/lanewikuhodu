The boxes were being opened, and when they got to Morgan’s CDs — they noticed that the image on the front of the case was that of music legend <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adele</a></strong>.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Morgan laughed as he pulled out an Adele CD instead of his own music, and he’s handling the situation like a champ. He also brought up a collaboration we never knew we needed, becoming our top wish for music this year.</p><p>“Adele, maybe the Gods are saying that we should be doing a duet together.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Craig Morgan (@cmorganmusic)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=572 data-injectable=true>Continuing to embrace the situation, Morgan said that the merch table would still be open for business, and that those in attendance could purchase one of her CDs at the show tonight!</p><p>“So tonight, Adele, we’re going to be selling your CDs at our merchandise table.”</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>We’re crossing our fingers that this was some supernatural sign that we’ll be getting a powerful duet between the pair soon.
