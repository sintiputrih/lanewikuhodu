I got back into dance in high school and started modeling. Going into the end of my high school career, I had been really into making trillers with my friends but never posted them. One day when I was scrolling through my Instagram stories I saw one of my friends post a story of her doing a TikTok dance to the song “Envy Me” which was really popular at the time and I downloaded the app. I started by posting dance videos to friends only. After a month or so I started posting publicly, and about two months after that I had a small following of about 10k.”</p><p>Back then she credited the “put a finger down” video on her TikTok for her success which garnered over 43 million views and 4.2 million likes.
