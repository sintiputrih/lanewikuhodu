In the family's 2012 memoir,&nbsp;<a href=#>Becoming Sister Wives: The Story of an Unconventional</a><a href=#> Marriage</a>,&nbsp;Kody wrote that "Meri was so cute and sweet when I met her that I had a hard time suppressing my hopelessly romantic nature".

She reflected on the upsetting loss during a 2012 episode of the TLC reality show. "I completely assumed that after I had Mariah, it would be very easy for me to conceive again," Meri stated at the time. "And that just didn't happen. So, after years of a rollercoaster, we had finally backed off... I was so frustrated and so angry. I didn't understand why, after another 12 years of trying, and then, it was just taken away from us. I didn't understand that. It was really hard."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Has The 'Sister Wives' Family Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-world-of-sister-wives><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The World Of 'Sister Wives'</span></h2><p>In September 2010, the Brown family took over the TLC limelight with the debut of their reality show. The first season introduced Kody's fourth wife, Robyn, who was the first new wife to come into the family in more than 15 years.</p><h2 id=switching-it-up><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Switching It Up</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kody and Meri got a divorce in September 2014, permitting him to legally marry Robyn to adopt her three children from her previous&nbsp;relationship: David, Aurora, and Breanna. "We have chosen to legally restructure our family," the Browns stated in an <a href=#>announcement</a> at the time. "We made this decision together as a family. We are grateful to our family, friends, and fans for all their love and support."</p><h2 id=moving-on><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Moving On?</span></h2><p>Two years after her divorce shook up the family dynamic, Meri pursued an online relationship- however, things weren't as they appeared. "At the very beginning, this person was fun, funny, just good conversation," Meri later described during a June 2016 episode of the TLC show after she got catfished by her crush. "At first, it was kind of cool just to have that companionship, I guess. I cared about who I thought she was portraying him to be because I have a trusting heart and a loving heart... The feelings that I had were very confusing." At the time, Kody stated that he felt "lost" in the circumstances. He recalled that "Meri and I were struggling enough. It was very hard to communicate."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-s-coming-out><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mariah's Coming Out</span></h2><p>During a January 2017 episode of&nbsp;Sister Wives, Meri and Kody struggled to accept their daughter's sexual orientation after she came out as gay. "I'm still in a state of processing this," Kody said to the cameras, telling them that the moment felt like a bomb being dropped. In a confessional, Meri confessed, "This is a little unexpected. I did not see this coming... Kind of surprises me that she's known for so long and hasn't said anything to us."</p><h2 id=bed-amp-breakfast-with-a-side-of-drama><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Bed & Breakfast With A Side Of Drama</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meri's hope of starting her own inn caused turmoil during season 13 of&nbsp;Sister Wives when Kody argued that the endeavor was "self-indulgent." At the time, Meri stated that her venture wasn't out of a wish "to be alone and independent in the business world or anything like that. It was just something that I needed to get done." Although the rest of the Browns were doubtful that the bed & breakfast would be successful, Meri was hopeful that they would change their minds. "I know they support it, and I think that if I needed help with the inn they would be right there," she stated.</p><h2 id=couples-therapy><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Couples Therapy</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a 2020 episode of the unscripted show, Kody and Meri determined that it was "time for us to actually take the temperature of our relationship" with the help of a professional.</p><h2 id=never-truly-over><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Never Truly Over</span></h2><p>Six years after her divorce- and in the midst of an especially tough time in her relationship- Meri put the minds of her fans at ease saying that she and Kody are determined to keep working on their marriage.

"Meri and I have been in a very dark place for a very long time," <a href=#>he made clear</a>. "It's been more about trying to get ourselves out of this hole that we dug ourselves into... I feel like my wives need to understand that- that they can leave. If it's not working for them, they can leave. Nobody's going to be a prisoner here."</p><h2 id=peace-at-last><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Peace At Last</span></h2><p>After Kody expressed during a February 2021 episode that his relationship with Meri lacked "value", she confessed that she didn't feel that way. <a href=#>She expressed at the time</a> that "I did not agree with that statement then, nor do I now because I think there is value to it." It's always hard looking back over, you know, some of the not-so-good and not so graceful moments on the show... There is always improvement to be made, but I am at peace where I am.
