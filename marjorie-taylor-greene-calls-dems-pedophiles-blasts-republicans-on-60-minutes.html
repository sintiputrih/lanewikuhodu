Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) doubled down on calling Democrats “pedophiles,” blasted establishment Republicans and demanded that the US stop the flow of aid money to Ukraine in a wide-ranging and fiery “60 Minutes” interview Sunday.</p><p>Taylor Greene, also known as MTG, made numerous controversial comments during her sit-down with veteran reporter Lesley Stahl — and was promptly panned by many across social media.</p><p>In one of the more shocking moments, the Georgia lawmaker responded, “I would definitely say so” when Stahl pressed her on previous comments she has made about Democrats being “the party of pedophiles.”</p><p>“They support grooming children,” Taylor Greene, 48, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> without providing evidence.</p><p>“Democrats support — even Joe Biden the president himself — support children being sexualized and having transgender surgeries. Sexualizing children is what pedophiles do to children.” &nbsp;</p><p>The Republican also took a shot at her own party — knocking a number of GOP lawmakers for not carrying out President Donald Trump’s priorities when he was in office.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rep.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah).</p><p>When asked why none of the blame falls on Trump, she said, “Well, the president doesn’t control everything.”</p><p>She also reiterated her opposition to funding weapons and financial aid for Ukraine to help Kyiv win its war against Russia’s brutal invasion.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rep.
