As most fans know, their breakup was quite the topic, since Joe broke up with Taylor in a 27-second phone call. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what Joe later on revealed</a> about the phone conversation:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"For those who have expressed concern over the '27 second' phone call, I called to discuss feelings with the other person. Those feelings were obviously not well received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk."</p><h2 id=sophie-turner-started-dating-joe-jonas-in-2016><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sophie Turner Started Dating Joe Jonas In 2016</span></h2><p>Joe Jonas started dating Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in October 2016</a> and a year later the couple got engaged. The two starts tied the knot in a Las Vegas chapel wedding on May 1, 2019, after which they decided to have another, <a href=#>more extravagant, wedding in Paris, France</a> on June 29, 2019.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About That Photo Of Sophie Turner Crying With Joe Jonas</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-sophie-turner-appeared-together-on-39-the-graham-norton-show-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Taylor Swift And Sophie Turner Appeared Together On 'The Graham Norton Show'</span></h2><p>Of course, no one ever expected Taylor Swift and Sophie Turner to bond, but it certainly seems as if the two ladies actually like each other. In 2019, both of them attended The Graham Norton Show, and it certainly seemed as if there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no bad blood between the two</a>.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-wrote-the-song-39-mr-perfectly-fine-39-about-joe-jonas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Taylor Swift Wrote The Song 'Mr. Perfectly Fine' About Joe Jonas</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that Taylor Swift often writes songs about her partners, so it's certainly not surprising that <a href=#>fans seem to thing she also wrote one about Joe Jonas</a>. In particular, the song "Mr. Perfectly Fine" seems to be about the Jonas Brother, and in the chorus of it, Swift is certainly roasting the singer:</p><p>"Hello Mr. Perfectly fine/How's your heart after breaking mine? / Mr. Always at the right place at the right time, baby / Hello Mr. Casually cruel / Mr. Everything revolves around you / I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye / And you're Mr. Perfectly fine."</p><h2 id=sophie-turner-shared-the-song-on-her-instagram-stories><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Sophie Turner Shared The Song On Her Instagram Stories</span></h2><p>Those who follow Sophie Turner on Instagram surely already know that the Queen in the North is a huge Swiftie. In fact, Turner didn't even care that Taylor Swift is roasting her husband Joe Jonas in "Mr. Perfectly Fine" — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she actually shared on Instagram stories that she is listening to the song</a>, and in addition to that, she wrote "It’s not NOT a bop @TaylorSwift."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, this didn't go unnoticed by Taylor Swift, who responded to the story by reposting it and adding "Forever bending the knee for the [queen] of the north."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Zendaya And Taylor Swift's Relationship Looks Like Today</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-sent-joe-and-sophie-39-s-daughter-a-gift><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Taylor Swift Sent Joe And Sophie's Daughter A Gift</span></h2><p>Swifties get to find out a lot about Taylor Swift's life through her songs, and one detail that didn't go unnoticed is the fact that in her song "Invisible String" she sings, "Cold was the steel of my axe to grind / For the boys who broke my heart / Now I send their babies presents." Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans were quick to conclude that she is talking about Joe Jonas,</a> as his wife Sophie Turner gave birth to their daughter Willa in July 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophie-turner-praised-taylor-swift-39-s-10-minute-version-of-39-all-too-well-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sophie Turner Praised Taylor Swift's 10-Minute Version Of 'All Too Well'</span></h2><p>This fall Taylor Swift released a 10-minute version of the song "All Too Well" from her album Red. The song has been a fan-favorite for years, and it seems as if Sophie — just like the rest of Taylor Swift's fandom — was not ready for the full version. When the song and music video came out, the Game of Thornes star once again decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">give Taylor Swift a shoutout on her Instagram story</a> by writing "I'm not fine at all @TaylorSwift."</p><h2 id=sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-attended-taylor-swift-39-s-39-snl-39-performance><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sophie Turner And Joe Jonas Attended Taylor Swift's 'SNL' Performance</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And finally, we're wrapping the list up with the fact that Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas attended Taylor Swift's "All Too Well" performance on Saturday Night Live this past November. While Joe Jonas and Taylor Swift certainly didn't end things on a good note back in 2008, it definitely seems as if they have managed to move past that. After all, Joe's wife Sophie Turner certainly seems to be a huge fan of his ex.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Sophie Turner And Joe Jonas' Relationship Leaves Fans Confused</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lo6S9qbXEZquuqp6av26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mnLGonJa2r7HDZqGonV2fvK%2Bt0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
