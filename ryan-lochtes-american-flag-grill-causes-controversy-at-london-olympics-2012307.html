ESPN's Wayne Drehs <a href=#>tweeted</a> that the 27-year-old swim phenom was told that he wouldn't receive his gold if he wore the bling on the winners' podium.</p><p>"I can only speculate that it may have been a uniform issue, that it may not have been part of the uniform," International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams told <a href=#>USA Today</a>, vowing to look into ESPN's initial report. Lochte put in his accessory after accepting his medal.</p><p>Made for the 2012 London Games exclusively, Lochte's grill — a "retainer filled with diamonds," the athlete has said — is his latest in a collection of specialty grills, which he has worn at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the 2009 World Championship in Rome, and the 2011 World Championship in Shanghai.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Love lives of athletes</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I wear it when I go on the podium," the champion swimmer said in a June 2011 posted to <a href=#>Speedo's YouTube page</a>. "It's just a unique way of showing personality out to everyone."</p><p>Earning a silver medal Sunday in the 4×100 freestyle relay, Lochte will go head-to-head with <strong>Michael Phelps</strong> August 1 for the second and final time in the 200-meter individual medley.</p><p>Want more Olympics?
