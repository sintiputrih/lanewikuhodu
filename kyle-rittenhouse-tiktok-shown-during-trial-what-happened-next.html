The killings, which Rittenhouse claims were in self-defense, took place during a period of unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Crowds had taken to the streets in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake two days prior. Rittenhouse had been present, carrying an AR-15 style rifle which, as of writing, the teen is currently being tried for unlawfully carrying.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Rittenhouse claims he was at the scene to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">protect a car dealership from vandals and to provide medical aid</a>, having departed his home with a medkit.
