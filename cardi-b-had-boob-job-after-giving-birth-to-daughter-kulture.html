[When] your skin is stretched out. Yes, my daughter f–ked me up. She did, she so did.”</p><p>The Hustlers actress, who shares her baby girl with her husband, <a href=#><strong>Offset</strong></a>, also opened up about the mom guilt she experiences while balancing motherhood with her&nbsp;hugely successful career.</p><p>“It makes me sad sometimes because it’s like, ‘Oh my gosh, all that traveling,'” Cardi told the outlet. ”I know her sleeping schedule is getting a little messed up … Every single time that she gets on an airplane, it’s all good until the landing. She starts crying, and I just be feeling so sad because I know the pain, you know, when your ears pop.”</p><p>She added: “Sometimes I wake up in the morning and she’s in my bed, and I just want to cuddle and [I can’t]. It is getting harder because she knows me. She recognizes more now and … you can just tell she wants me to be there. Sometimes, when she sees me leaving, she looks up and goes, ‘Bitch, where you going?’”</p><p>Cardi may travel a lot, but the Bronx native was with Kulture for one major moment in particular. After taking home her first <a href=#>Grammy</a>, she documented <a href=#>her daughter saying, “Mama.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Oh, my God!” the new mom screamed when the baby girl spoke. She captioned the sweet Instagram footage, “After a week of only saying papa! She saying mama! Happy 7 months Kulture! We love you.”</p><p>Cardi and the Migos rapper, 27, <a href=#>welcomed their child in July 2018</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaKZtm6ujKGYnWWSpLyjecmomWaZlqmys3nGoq2ippdir6q%2B06Fkraddma62s8etnKtlm6q5tcHRnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
