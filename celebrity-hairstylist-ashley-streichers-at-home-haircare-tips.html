I would recommend washing it 2-3 times a week depending on your hair type and using a mask like <a href=#>Garnier’s Hydrating Treat Mask with Aloe Extracts</a> once a week to get your hair super healthy.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Even if you’re packing in the at-home workouts, there’s no need to wash your hair every time you get your sweat on. “Sweat is not greasy or dirty, especially if you are a healthy person with good eating habits,” she dishes.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In fact, Streicher says that sweat can actually be used as a great natural salt spray. “Sweat can give you great volume and texture. … After sweating, let your hair down and don’t touch it, let it dry completely and then use a clean dry shampoo,” she says. “Do not blow dry it after a workout though, as that can create frizz.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>If you are craving that fresh blowout feeling you’d get after visiting the hair guru at&nbsp;<a href=#><span class=s2>Striiike</span></a>, a beauty studio in Beverly Hills run by Ashley and her two sisters <strong>Jenn</strong> and <strong>Kristie Streicher</strong> where hair, makeup and brows are crafted, here are the steps you need to follow:&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ashley-Streicher-Hair-Emily-Blunt-Inline.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Spray a bit of <a href=#>Garnier’s Fructis Invisible Dry Shampoo</a> into the roots of your hair and give yourself a little head massage, getting all of your roots moving to help absorb any oil. Next, section out the front of your hair, mostly the hairline, and take a small round brush and smooth it out while also getting some volume. This gives the illusion that you have a fresh blowout.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>If that’s not enough of a pick-me-up for you and your bangs or layers are in desperate need of a trim, Streicher says sticking with very small and very sharp scissors is key. “The small scissors help so that you can only take a little bit at a time, which keeps you from lopping off big chunks of hair on accident. … I also recommend cutting them dry and as you wear them, so that way you will know exactly how they will lay.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And if you’re looking an easy DIY style, Streicher says hydrating products, hair accessories and braids can make all the difference. “Try&nbsp;air drying out of the shower with a little <a href=#>Whole Blends 10 in 1 Miracle Nectar</a> or use<a href=#>&nbsp; Garnier  Fructis Style Pure Clean  Detangler and  Air Dry</a> for a nice <a href=#>beachy look</a>,” she spills.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>“I also love bright and colorful <a href=#>Chunks clips</a> for a cool, bright pop of color and instead of over styling, try some braiding tutorials and learn some heat-free techniques,” Streicher suggests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5iyrbHBq6CtsV2drqq%2B0q2wpaGjqXqiv8elnLJlo6m%2FprXCoZyrq12WwW60zqacZqCRnr%2BkrdGeZK2hoKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
