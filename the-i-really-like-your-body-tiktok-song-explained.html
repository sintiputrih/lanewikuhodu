Ed Sheeran was impossible to escape during the “Bad Habits” trend and Olivia Rodrigo earned hordes of new fans after not one, or even two, but three of her debut album’s tracks made it onto TikTok ‘for you’ pages everywhere.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=297 data-current-count=297 data-injectable=false>When a TikTok trend is centered around a popular or chart-topping song, it’s relatively easy for users to track down the song’s origin. More obscure music occasionally makes its way onto the app, however, leading interested users down a rabbit hole as they attempt to discover its roots.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>The latest track to send TikTokers into a frenzy is mostly known as the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I Really Like Your Body</a>” TikTok song. This is due to the opening lyrics of the clip that’s gained popularity on TikTok, which opens with “I really like to party/ I really like your body/I really wanna get naughty/I think you’re such a hottie.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>Apart from its addictively languid rhythm and memorable lyrics, many people remain uninformed about the increasingly popular song. Never fear⏤we’ve got all the details you need.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>What is the “I Really Like Your Body” TikTok song?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true><a title=@riwww href=#>@riwww</a><p>nyc is so beautiful</p><a title="♬ SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY - Remix - Amaarae & Kali Uchis" href=#>♬ SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY – Remix – Amaarae & Kali Uchis</a></figure><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>Unsurprisingly, the actual song isn’t really titled “I Really Like Your Body.” The original track, from artist Amaarae featuring Moliy, is titled “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sad Gurlz Luv Money.</a>”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>The clip that now soundtracks thousands of TikToks is taken from near the end of a remix of Amaarae and Moliy’s sensual, breathy song. The remix, which adds the languorous tones of Kali Uchis into the mix, doesn’t massively alter the vibe of the original song. Instead it enhances it in subtle ways, contributing Uchis’ voice to the original pair’s sultry duet and picking up the tempo in a few key areas.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>The audio clip is being used to soundtrack serene videos of bustling cities and rainy nights along with quite a few videos detailing what many women think men consider “hottie” behavior. The majority of the entries into the trend simply show people feeling themselves, occasionally mouthing along to the lyrics, but mostly simply taking a moment to appreciate their own unique beauty.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>The reception to the trend is almost universally positive. People are flooding the comments section of participants’ vids with words of admiration and encouragement, and many of the videos participating in the trend have view counts in the hundreds of thousands.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>Given the general relationship between TikTok and popular music, it seems likely that its popularity on <strong>TikTok</strong> will see “Sad Gurlz Luv Money” topping music charts within a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46tn55lmWK%2Fpq3LpbBmpJmgsm7Fzq6pZpqfmcZuwMikq6ijXai8r7OMnq%2BppJGeu6awjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
