Particularly suspicious was that Anthony initially purported her daughter to be the victim of a kidnapping, but never reported her disappearance to the authorities. It was only after smelling what appeared to be the odor of a decomposing body in her trunk that Casey’s mother, Cindy Anthony, finally contacted the police.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Skeletal remains of the child’s body were eventually found inside a laundry bag in a wooded area near the family’s house, where Anthony lived with her parents, five months after Caylee was reported missing.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>However, even though both the jury and court of public opinion felt that Anthony was most certainly guilty, a lack of evidence during the trial led to her acquittal on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, and aggravated manslaughter of a child. She was found guilty on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement and was released less than two weeks later with time served.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>Even more damning was computer evidence that surfaced after the trial completed, which only further fueled outrage over the not-guilty verdict.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>After 11 years, Casey Anthony breaks her silence for the first time on camera.</p><p>Casey Anthony: Where The Truth Lies, a 3-part limited series, premieres November 29 only on Peacock. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TMHXFQfiNA</a></p>— Peacock (@peacock) <a href=#>November 8, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>So in other words, even though more than a decade has gone by since the trial, it goes without saying that the masses are not exactly ready to forgive Casey Anthony. Though we don’t know what she’s going to say, it seems very unlikely that Anthony will confess to the murder of her child — or provide any meaningful evidence of her innocence — and will instead just profit from her appearance.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>As such, it seems extremely questionable and exploitative that NBC would proceed with a docuseries like this with Anthony’s full participation, and people sounded off in full force after catching wind of the limited series.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t have a peacock subscription but if I did I would cancel it over this <a href=#>https://t.co/pUypX9jOzD</a></p>— andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) <a href=#>November 8, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is morally bankrupt.
