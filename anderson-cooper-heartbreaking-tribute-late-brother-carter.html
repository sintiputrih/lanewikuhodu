Penning a heartbreaking tribute to his late sibling, Carter, the CNN star posted several black-and-white photos from their early childhood together. The caption read: "It is 35 years today since my brother, Carter Cooper, died. I think of him, and miss him, every day."&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=ellJg5pE5DH data-wc=14>Carter passed away on July 22 1988 from suicide at the age of 23.&nbsp;</p><p id=eiEmD985dZ_ data-wc=32>Shortly after posting the tribute, Anderson was inundated with condolences and well-wishes from fans. "Those we love deeply and lose are imprinted forever on our broken hearts. Sending you love," replied one.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6c746bfb6add-gloria-vanderbilt-carter-and-anderson-cooper.jpg><p id=edTrVfVcn6w data-wc=8><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Anderson Cooper's children: Cutest photos and more</a></p><p id=eRvwzfgKp7 data-wc=16><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Elton John inundated with messages after heartbreaking loss of 'loved and adored friend' Tony Bennett</a></p><p id=ekQZHugvr6F data-wc=47>"Anderson, I've never had the privilege of seeing you in person, much less call you a friend. But if I were with you right now, I'd give you a tight hug.

Angels all around," and a fourth added: "Beautiful brothers. Our hearts are with you."</p><p id=ebSCOLzYXVB data-wc=33>Anderson, 56, has spoken about the loss of his brother on numerous occasions. Tragically, Carter had jumped to his death from their family's 14th-floor penthouse apartment in front of their mother, Gloria Vanderbilt.&nbsp;</p><p id=ekQwiIzI6jF data-wc=32>Reflecting on Carter's death in a 2022 interview with his friend and colleague Christiane Amanpour, Anderson admitted that the incident had continued to haunt his mother Gloria until the day she died.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/7282fbbe1162-anderson-cooper-gloria-vanderbilt.jpg><p id=euQAk4Ge6e3 data-wc=24>"She relived it constantly. She replayed it in her head every single day of her life for the rest of her life," he said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eL-VyuH3vn6 data-wc=54>"My mom, until the day she died, she would out of the blue say to me, 'Maybe if I had grabbed an iron from the fireplace and hit Carter, it would have knocked him out, and maybe that would have stopped him. I could have stopped him from going to the balcony,'" he explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=eotcmufBiO_ data-wc=25>"She could never get to a place where she could accept the death, but she got to a place where she could continue to live."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/7dbfdfe0ffea-anderson-cooper-black-suit.jpg><p id=eSLfMhLHw61 data-wc=34>Anderson has also confessed that he continues to struggle with it. "Any time you lose a loved one, especially when you're younger, it alters the trajectory of your life," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p id=eSAS2MCNNZg data-wc=59>"It's inconceivable to me that my brother died in 1988 and I've lived more of my life without him than I have with him. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about what he would be doing, who he would be, and I still think about his death and have questions about it," he said.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Stars gone too soon</figure><p id=eV_fauXQlUm data-wc=51>Following Carter's death, Anderson went on to launch his own podcast about grief and loss, titled 'All There Is'. After launching in September 2022, listeners have continued to commend and thank Anderson for his honesty, with many crediting the star for having helped them come to terms with their own grief.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWXbGtuZ5Gjsaa%2B0qilZpufpL2mvoyhnJqqpJe%2Fpq3KoqWgZaSntqPB055kpZmkmnqjvs6tn56qXZius8DEq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
