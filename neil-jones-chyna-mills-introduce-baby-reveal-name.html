I'm so happy that I saw it all," he says. "I had tears in my eyes. Seeing what Chyna had just gone through, and then Havana coming out and being placed on her chest. Havana had the tiniest cry. It was unbelievable."</p><h2>Baby Havana's personality</h2><p id=eZ5uHEpYnx data-wc=38>Havana's sweet personality is already coming out. "She's quite chilled but when she wants something, all hell will break loose until she gets it," says Chyna – "So she's just like her mum!" adds Neil with a laugh.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8CEKIk0Bro data-wc=43>"It would be amazing if she wants to be a dancer, but she can be whatever she wants to be," Neil tells us, before quipping: "Although, she has to be a Liverpool supporter – that's non-negotiable. She's got a little football kit already."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8c25c52bd2b0-chyna-mills-baby-posing.jpg><h2>Strictly Come Dancing babies</h2><p id=ev3y3hMEY6 data-wc=26>As Havana grows up, she can look forward to getting to know a whole host of little playmates in the form of her fellow babies.&nbsp;</p><p id=e84jjngtWLA data-wc=52>Former pros <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Janette Manrara</a> and Aljaz Skorjanec's <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>baby daughter Lyra</a> is just a few months older than Havana, and Neil's fellow dancer Gorka Marquez welcomed his second child – son Thiago – with fiancée Gemma Atkinson earlier this year. Both families are based in the north of England, like Neil and Chyna.&nbsp;</p><p id=exaLixQUc8m data-wc=66>"I was talking to Aljaz and he said he is always dancing around with his baby girl in his arms – and so am I," says Neil. "I said to the pros: 'I want you all to speak to her in your own languages,'" he adds. "Nancy and Carlos can speak to her in Chinese… I would love her to learn as many languages as possible."</p><p id=el7eZSs5p5T data-wc=13>"She'll have tons of baby-sitters and dance teachers around her," points out Chyna.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>Relive Neil Jones and Chyna Mills' gender reveal:</figure><h2>Neil Jones and Chyna Mills' wedding plans</h2><p id=evSakbt7OE data-wc=50>Still on cloud nine after becoming parents, Neil and Chyna – who got engaged in the stunning rice terraces of Bali earlier this year – have more happy times in store as they look ahead to getting married.
