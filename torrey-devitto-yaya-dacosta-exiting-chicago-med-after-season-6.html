But it is now time for me and her to bow out and say goodbye. Thank you to all you loyal watchers who adored her as much as I did.”</p><p>She added, “I can’t wait to share what’s to come with all of you. New adventures await!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Chicago-Med-Shocker-Torrey-DeVitto-Yaya-DaCosta-Leaving-at-End-Season-6.jpg><p>The <a href=#>One Tree Hill</a> vet has joined the cast of indie feature Skelly, according to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, while the America’s Next Top Model alum will star in Our Kind Of People.</p><p><strong>S.

The actor, 38, was surprised by the exit but was happy to <a href=#>return for a goodbye episode in season 5</a>, during which the character chose to leave town for a new job.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“He <a href=#>left on his own terms</a>, which I thought was really lovely for the character and for me personally,” the former Affair star told Us in 2019. “One of the best working experiences of my life was being a part of Med and that was, in large part, due to the leadership at the top. I would love to go back. I would love to pop in here and there, and I sort of have a history of doing that now on shows! It probably won’t be as wild of ways as I do on Arrow, but I’m really very happy and thankful to them that they gave me the exit that they did so that the door is open for the future.”</p><p>Chicago Med airs on NBC Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuoqqKaxm6wxK%2BgrayfYsaixcBmm5qbn6jBonnEsaCtoZ6ceqS0yJyYoKddorKlecCfq56qXaiyor%2FOp2RvZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
