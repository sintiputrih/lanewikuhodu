The Mission Impossible actor also agreed to shoulder "medical, dental, insurance, education, college and other extracurricular costs".</p><p id=eeWn3ywizwao data-wc=48>Aside from finances, the pair also set out boundaries when it came to religion. Tom is a devout Scientologist, and when he split from his first wife Nicole Kidman in 2001, their two adopted children Isabella and Connor continued to be Scientologists and drifted apart from their mother.</p><p id=ePD_8giwmZ37 data-wc=40>Catholic-raised Katie was supposedly afraid of history repeating itself with Suri, which is why she sought sole custody. This allowed her to remove her daughter from any Scientology-influenced schools, like the Delphian School in Oregon where Tom's older children attended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/25e40b2aaa2e-suricruise-university.jpg><p id=eUBY1eDVzdW4 data-wc=18>Instead, Suri attended LaGuardia High School and has hinted she is <a class=hm-link href=#>planning to study at Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</p><p id=eoKeIf4v0e9y data-wc=29>According to TMZ, Katie and Tom's divorce agreement also included restrictions on what they could tell Suri regarding religion.

Obviously, she's got her mum too, so potentially, Suri's attachment style is secure because she's had two parents emotionally and physically available in those early years of her life, which is super important."</p><p id=e3pNJYB6NzhJ data-wc=24>Former Scientologist Samantha Domingo told<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;Us Weekly</a> that Tom was "not allowed" to have a relationship with Suri as she was not a Scientologist.</p><p id=e7XbBRgLz9bQ data-wc=25>Samantha explained the Church's belief in reincarnation means they would not view Suri as Tom's daughter, but as a "spiritual being in Tom's daughter's body."</p><p id=ehLgMXnEbaOW data-wc=38>Tom has denied these claims, stating his busy work schedule has prevented them from spending time together. The physical distance also doesn't help, since Suri lives in New York City and Tom has made London his primary base.</p><p id=eZv1fRd9-fKE data-wc=18><strong>DISCOVER: <a class=hm-link href=#>The stars whose kids have regular jobs: from Bruce Springsteen's firefighter son to Harrison Ford's chef son</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
