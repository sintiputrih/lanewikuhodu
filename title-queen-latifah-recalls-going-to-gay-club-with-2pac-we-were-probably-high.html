According to <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Queen Latifah</a>, the late Hip Hop legend was also the mastermind behind the Humpty Dance. Speaking to Hot Ones,&nbsp;Queen Latifah was shown a throwback photo of herself and ‘Pac, then dove into some of her fondest memories of their friendship.</p><p>“Me and 2Pac were pretty much labelmates,” she explained.” I was signed to Tommy Boy Records. Digital Underground was signed to Tommy Boy Records. Initially, I took Treach on the road as my roadie. Treach went on to head Naughty By Nature and 2Pac was pretty much a roadie with Digital. And he became a rapper in the group and made up the Humpty Dance, and they made the song ‘The Humpty Dance,’ which 2Pac created the dance to and it became a smash hit.”</p><p></p><p><a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Queen Latifah</a> also recalled a particular show at a gay club in San Francisco where 2Pac agreed to meet her, although he didn’t exactly know what he was walking into.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“We toured together, so we went all across the county,” she continued. “I was in San Francisco doing a show. It was my first show over $10,000, which was a New Year’s Eve show at this cool gay club in San Francisco. I was like, ‘Yo I’m here!’ So 2Pac came to club with me. I was like, ‘Yo, 2Pac is in the building!’</p><p>“They went crazy in there. They like, ‘Take off your clothes!’ He took his shirt off anywhere. We had so much fun. But that was like my brother and he’s the type of person if he loved you, if he was cool with you, he’d lay his life down for you. I miss him and I love him. Good times. And we were probably high. Anyway [laughs].”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/12/2pac-hard-drive-music-photos-auction.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>2Pac Ex-Bodyguard Shares Rare Footage Of Hip Hop Legend On Tour With Digital Underground</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>May 22, 2022</p></a><p>Both 2Pac and Digital Underground frontman Shock G are no longer with us, but just last month rare footage of ‘Pac on the road with the group surfaced online.
