Now the musician, 55, claims he spent $130,000 on rehab for his 22-year-old son, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Pamela Anderson</strong>.</p><p>Close to midnight on Tuesday, June 19, Tommy tweeted: “Rehab for son: $130,000. Party for son’s 21st birthday last year: $40,000. Medical Bills after son knocks his father unconscious and uses ‘alcoholism’ as scapegoat: $10,000. Son acting like a victim on social media on father’s day: Priceless.

Today I am almost two years sober. Every day that goes by I feel ever more grateful. My clear mind has allowed me to do a lot with this time. So much so that I would like to offer to pay for his treatment.”</p><p>On Father’s Day, the drummer made an Instagram post extolling the challenges of fatherhood. “It’s a rollercoaster, OK?” he wrote. “Sometimes I feel like I failed as a father, because my kids don’t know the value of things. If they break something, they don’t care because they know they’ll just get a new one, if they hurt someone, they don’t care because so many people tell them it’s OK. I never wanted this for my kids … I love them dearly, don’t get me wrong, but man, sometimes it’s really tough to watch your kids grow up without those morals. Nothing can really prepare you for fatherhood … I love my boys but they can be a–holes, too.”</p><p>These are just the latest volleys in the war between Tommy and Brandon, his first child with Anderson, 50. The father and son <a href=#>reportedly came to blows</a> in March. In a since-deleted tweet, the rocker shared a photo of his bloodied mouth and claimed that Brandon was the culprit. A source told Us Weekly that the alleged incident was “representative of much bigger problems with family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp52ixm64xJ5komWjpbKvwIxqamloYGV6sLqMq5yhmZJis7C%2BjKymp2WSp66vsM6nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
