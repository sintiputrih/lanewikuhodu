Audiences swarmed to the wealth of minions content during their <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Minions: The Rise of Gru</a></strong> screenings, in hopes of catching up on the story thus far. The franchise appears to be far from finished with Gru and his brightly-colored Minions, and is already planning ahead for future releases.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>As audiences continue to enjoy the latest entry in the franchise, the previous films are also on the rise on viewing platforms. Here’s how to enjoy each of the films in the Despicable Me franchise, in order of release.</p><h2 id=h-despicable-me-2010 data-injectable=false>Despicable Me (2010)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true>The film that started it all still holds up spectacularly. Many of us didn’t expect much when we headed to theaters for the very first Despicable Me release, but we left theaters dazzled. More than a decade later, the flick is just as delightful as it was the first time around, and audiences continue to heap praise on its charming reversal of a classic formula.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>The film subverts the typical hero trope by instead orienting its story around an ambitious villain, one who’s set his sights on a very lofty goal: stealing the Earth’s moon. In the process, he employs the help of three adorable children — Margo, Edith, and Agnes — who are initially intended as pawns, but eventually become family to the nefarious Gru.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>Fans looking to stream the OG Despicable Me film can enjoy it with a subscription to Peacock, or rent it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a> for $3.79.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Despicable Me 2 (2013)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>The first Despicable Me was hugely successful, particularly for an animated flick, and prompted the studio behind the surprise hit to return to the story with a sequel. The second film is almost as popular as the first among audiences — a rare thing for sequels — thanks in large part to the stellar cast. The movie features the return of Steve Carell as Gru, alongside stars like Kristen Wiig, Russell Brand, and Steve Coogan.</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>It follows Gru as he attempts to adjust to a non-villainous life as a father and caregiver, and is widely lauded as one of the better sequels out there. It is currently streamable with a Peacock subscription or can be rented at the same cost as the first from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Minions (2015)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>The first-ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Minions spin-off</a> was far less popular than the films that preceeded it, but it remains a top pick for many young audiences. The film sees the first Despicable Me entry to depart from Steve Carell’s Gru, instead shifting its focus to the pill-shaped, gibberish-speaking minions that exist to serve the “most despicable master around.” Reviews for the film largely label it a flop, but also largely ignore the audience these films are clearly intended for children.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>While adults may find <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Minion-centric</a> films to be an utter drag, kids generally seem to like them. Plus, it once again boasts a bafflingly stacked voice cast, with heavyweights like Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, and Michael Keaton lending their voices to the film.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>And thankfully, with streaming, parents can toss the film on and walk away. Minions is available to stream on Netflix and can also be rented on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a> for as low for $3.79.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Despicable Me 3 (2017)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>One of the lowest-rated entries in the Despicable Me franchise, the third entry in the initial series sees the return of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, and the debut of South Park‘s Trey Parker. The film continues the evolution of the Despicable Me franchise, as former villains work to maintain order and prevent new villains from enacting chaos. It also delves much deeper into Gru’s family tree, and, despite criticism of a “convoluted” story and dull plot, remains a favorite among its intended audience — particularly for its sticky, gum-coated final fight.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Like Minions, it is absent from Peacock’s streaming library but can be rented from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a> for $3.79.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>The most recent entry in the Despicable Me franchise adds Gru <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">into the Minions mix</a>, likely in hopes of leaning on Steve Carell’s talent and star power to avoid another entirely Minion-centric film. It follows Gru in his youth, as he begins his journey toward a villainous future, and adds in the extremely talented Michelle Yeoh and a surprise appearance from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a> to add even more celebrity clout to the mix.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>Rise of Gru is already more popular than either of its direct predecessors, with reviewers largely praising it for its “goofball nonsense” and for its appeal to younger audiences.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>It can be streamed on Peacock and is available to rent on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon Prime</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Despicable Me 4 (2024)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>A <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth Despicable Me film</a> is already in development and slated for a July 2024 release. Not much is known about the film thus far, but fans of the franchise can delight in the fact that more is yet to come.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shorts and adaptations</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>If the wealth of options listed above still doesn’t manage to scratch that Despicable Me itch, there’s plenty more where that came from. On top of the five already-released films, the franchise boasts a number of short films, television specials, and even a video game adaptation.</p><p data-characters=38 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Most of these can be found on YouTube.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZZGhuW7Ax55knZ2jpbakrcGlnGallWKur7CMpqCnoZ%2BjwG65zq%2Bgnqtdnrtuu9GdnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
