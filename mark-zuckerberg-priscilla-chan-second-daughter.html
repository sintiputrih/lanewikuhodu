Your mom and I are so excited to see who you will become. Childhood is magical. You only get to be a child once, so don't spend it worrying too much about the future. You've got us for that, and we'll do everything we possibly can to make sure the world is a better place for you and all children in your generation." He added: "I hope even in your dreams you can feel how much we love you. August, we love you so much and we're so excited to go on this adventure with you. We wish you a life of joy, love and the same hope you give us."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eJFTgPNMjDGy data-wc=92>Mark and Priscilla tied the knot at their Palo Alto home in California in May 2012. The couple's daughter Max celebrated her first birthday in November, with a party at home alongside her parents. In March, the Facebook CEO announced on the social media site that he and his paediatrician wife were expecting a second baby. "Priscilla and I are happy to share we're expecting another baby girl," he wrote. "After our difficult experience with having Max, we weren't sure what to expect or whether we'd be able to have another child."</p><p id=e9VYGWIi23xE><a class=hm-link href=#>STORY:&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla expecting baby number two</a></p><p id=e_GY2bne9r8u data-wc=110>He continued: "When Priscilla and I first found out she was pregnant again, our first hope was that the child would be healthy. My next hope was that it would be a girl. I cannot think of a greater gift than having a sister and I'm so happy Max and our new child will have each other. I grew up with three sisters and they taught me to learn from smart, strong women. They weren't just my sisters but some of my best friends. They've gone on to write books, excel at performance, music, sports, cooking and their careers. They showed me how to compete and still laugh together afterwards."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
