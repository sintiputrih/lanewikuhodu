Besides, Healy is too tragic and salacious a character not to discuss.</p><p>Born in Texas, Healy was a talented comedian, actor, and vaudeville performer who had a successful career â€“- he even influenced legendary comedian Bob Hope, according to <a href=#>Empire</a>. But Healy was a mean drunk. His on-stage act of verbally or physically assaulting his stooges wasn't too far from the real-life truth. Shemp was so sick of Healy's drunkenness that he quit and went out on his own. When the stooges were offered a contract that didn't include Healy, the former star allegedly completely lost it, threatening to bomb theaters showing the Three Stooges, although this is disputed in Healy's biography <a href=#>Nobody's Stooge</a>.</p><p>Three years later, Healy was doing fine without the Three Stooges. His new film The Hollywood Hotel had a successful premiere, and he went out that night for some drinks at the Trocadero night club in Los Angeles. Shortly thereafter, Healy wound up in his hotel room, beaten to a pulp. The next morning, he was dead.</p><p>Albert "Cubby" Broccoli, a filmmaker connected to the infamous mobster Lucky Luciano, admitted to getting in a fight outside the Trocadero with Healy that night. Precisely what happened and whether Healy was murdered remains a mystery, but his influence on the Three Stooges remains a lasting part of their legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkG5wampfqbWmedOrmKChk2K%2Fpq3LZqOinpViwLW70bJkqJ5dqbWmedOhqZ6dXajBsLvGnqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
