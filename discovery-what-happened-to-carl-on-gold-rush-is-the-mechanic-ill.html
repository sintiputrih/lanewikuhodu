Season 11 episode 17 sees the show’s mechanic forced to leave the mining show for emergency surgery.</strong></p><p>The people who star in Gold Rush are no strangers to the odd injury. Season 11 sees Johnny slip on a rock, while broken arms and other injuries have also occurred in past seasons.</p><p>But, when it comes to Carl Rosk, the severity of his illness looks to have taken him off the show. So, let’s take a look at Carl and what happened to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-20-at-11.29.37-1024x572.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-carl-rosk>Who is Carl Rosk?</h3><p>Carl Rosk is a cast member on The Discovery Channel’s Gold Rush.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Discovery</a>, Carl was born into the gold mining trade and owns 1,000 acres of land which he mined with his late grandfather.</p><p>Eating pizza, dirt biking, fishing and hunting are all past times of Carl’s – when he’s not mining for gold, of course.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-to-carl-on-gold-rush>What happened to Carl on Gold Rush?</h3><p>Carl has appeared on Gold Rush since 2015. Six years later, he’s a familiar face on the Discovery show.</p><p>Fans of the show were understandably concerned when it was revealed that Carl would be taking a break from the show in episode 17, ‘Growing Pains’, to receive emergency surgery.</p><p>By the looks of things, Carl’s ill health isn’t new to some Gold Rusg viewers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>A Reddit thread</a> from 2019 discusses how Rick spoke of Carl’s health problems during season 9 episode 12.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=does-carl-from-gold-rush-have-cancer>Does Carl from Gold Rush have cancer?</h3><p>It doesn’t seem that Carl has spoken publicly about his health, surgery or cancer.</p><p>However, there has been an ongoing theme in the show that he has disappeared for multiple surgeries.</p><p>Reddit users took to the internet in 2021 to discuss whether Carl is in ill health or not in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>thread</a>.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Reddit user</a> <a href=#>The-Scotsman</a> said: “The tumour was mentioned a year or two ago in a previous season. THis is just surgery to get it removed. It’s a positive thing. They said it didn’t go as quickly as normal, but I’d expect he’ll be fine in he end.“</p><p><a href=#>PM-Me-Electrical</a> said: “He talked about having a tumor on his lung and another on his spine, Season 9, Episode 11, so it’s been with him a while.”</p><p>Season 9 episode 11 saw Carl not only state that he has a tumour, but he also had a breakdown during the show. It’s likely that Carl has exited season 11 for surgery for a tumour, however, he hasn’t confirmed any details about his health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-20-at-11.29.56-1024x635.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnlJ7ApLvVnqmyZaedrrV5x5qnqZ2emrFuwM5mmpqqnGK8r3nGqKOdZaKqwKl5yKxkraCVYrqmr8eapaKbXZ65rQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
