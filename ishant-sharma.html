He has been able to take 68 wickets in 14 first-class games, including a five-wicket haul against Baroda on the opening day of a match Delhi drew after failing to bowl Baroda out on the fourth day. Likewise, he toured England along with the India Under-19s in the year 2006 and Pakistan in the year 2006 to 2007. Ishant played three youth tests as well as six youth One Day Internationals for his country, India.</p><p>Based on his strong performance in Australia in the year 2008, he was bought for a winning bid of $950K by Kolkata Knight Riders in the player auction for the Indian Premier League. And, this was the highest amount paid for any bowler in the tournament. Moreover, in February 2018, it was officially announced that Ishant will join Sussex CCC for the first two months of the 2018 county season, available from 4 April to 4 June 2018. This made him the 9th Indian to play for Sussex.</p><p>Ishant was in the test team for the Bangladesh tour in May 2007 and played as a replacement for the fast bowler Munaf Patel. He played for his national side in the second test over there where he bowled three overs including one maiden and conceded only five runs without taking a wicket. And, later on, Sharma was called for a tour of England in July–August in the year 2007.</p><p>Likewise, he got a call back in the team in the 3rd Test during Pakistan’s tour of India in December 2007 due to the injury of India’s frontline pacers Zaheer Khan, RP Singh, and Sreesanth. Sharma was able to pick up 5 wickets during the third test in Bangalore. This performance helped him earn a place in India’s squad for the tour of Australia.</p><h4>More About Career</h4><p>Unfortunately, Ishant Sharma was left out in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne during the Border–Gavaskar Trophy as India retained their main fast bowlers, Zaheer Khan and RP Singh. However, in January 2008 he was able to represent India once again to replace the injured Zaheer Khan in the second test at the SCG. He&nbsp;began the first day of the match strongly and was involved in a controversial decision from Steve Bucknor when Andrew Symonds nicked the ball to keeper MS Dhoni off his bowling but was given not out.</p><p>The management retained him for the third Test match at Perth, even though Ishant had little success. Then, he bowled an exceptional spell to Australian captain Ricky Ponting that resulted in his wicket on the fourth day of the match and helped India claim victory. In the following test played in Adelaide, he was able to pick up two wickets and even impressed everyone with his bowling.</p><p>Likewise, in February 2008, Ishant was able to bag four important wickets in the 4th ODI of the CB Series against Australia. He was able to end the match with figures of 4/38 and was named Man of the Match. And, during the 2008 Test series against Australia in India, he was the leading wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. Ishant thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev won the award in the year 1983. However, in the year 2009, his form slumped, and he was dropped and replaced by Sreesanth for the second Test against Sri Lanka.</p><h4>International Career</h4><p>Moreover, in October 2010, Ishant Sharma helped VVS Laxman pull off a highly unlikely win over Australia by one wicket in the first Test in Mohali after India had fallen to 8/124 in pursuit of 205. He supported Laxman during an 81-run partnership in which he contributed 31 valuable runs.</p><p>In the 2011 IPL auction, the Deccan Chargers bought Ishant Sharma; he hoped that his performance in the competition would give him a chance to impress selectors and push for selection in India’s ODI team. From 12 matches, he took 11 wickets at an average of 28.54. And, a month after the IPL, which was held in April and May, India toured the West Indies for five ODIs and three Tests. India won the first three ODIs, and Ishant Sharma was called into the team for the fourth, his first ODI since August 2010. Likewise, he was able to manage one wicket from two matches in the series while conceding 109 runs. And, the first Test resulted in a win for India and Ishant was able to take three wickets in each innings.</p><p>Ishant Sharma claimed his 100th Test wicket in the second Test, becoming the fifth-youngest to reach the landmark. And, the fixture was also the first time he took ten wickets in a match for India. Likewise, the second, as well as third tests, ended in draws, and India won the series 1–0. And, Ishant was the leading wicket-taker with 22 dismissals at an average of 16.86 on either side.</p><h4>More About International Career</h4><p>India suffered a run of eight consecutive defeats in away Tests after the tour of the West Indies. And, England replaced India as the No. 1 ranked Test team. During the series, Ishant Sharma suffered an ankle injury and missed the ODI leg. In the year 2012, he underwent surgery on his ankle. Because of the operation, he missed the 2012 IPL. Likewise, in the year 2013, India vs. Australia ODI series, he gave away 30 runs in an over. However, after some bad performances against Australia in the 2013 ODI series, Sharma came back strongly against South Africa which was his 2nd best performance in ODIs.</p><p>In the 2014 tour of England, Ishant Sharma secured his career with an aggressive spell in England’s second innings, bowling India to a 95-run win. India was able to finish the series losing 3–1. Ishant finished the 2015 three-match Test series in Sri Lanka with 13 wickets, including a 5-wicket haul in the third Test at SSC. And, at the end of the match, he was handed a one-match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC), following an altercation with Dhammika Prasad in the course of the match.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-127951 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Ishant-Sharma-Cricket.jpg alt="Ishant Sharma" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-127951 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Ishant playing Cricket (Source: Instagram)</p><h4>Career and IPL Career</h4><p>Likewise, in August 2018, Ishant took his 250th Test wicket during the fourth Test against England. He was able to finish the series as the second-highest wicket-taker, with 18 wickets. And, following India’s tour of Australia, he took 11 wickets in the first 3 tests, before being ruled out of the final test due to an injury.</p><p>Ishant took his 9th Test 5-wicket haul against West Indies in August 2019. And, in the 2nd Test match of the same series, batting at No.9, he hit his first half-century in Test Cricket. Likewise, in February 2021, he completed his 100th Test match against England in the third Test match of the England Tour of India, at the Motera Stadium. Moreover, Ishant became only the 4th Indian bowler to play 100 test matches.</p><p>Furthermore, Ishant was able to play for Kings XI Punjab in the Indian Premier League. And, in December 2018, the Delhi Capitals bought him in the player auction for the 2019 Indian Premier League.</p><h4>Bowling Style</h4><p>A right-arm fast-medium bowler, the speed of Ishant’s bowling has diminished since he emerged on the international scene. However in the year 2008, he bowled a delivery at over 152 kilometers per hour (94 mph). And, such occurrences were not the norm as Sharma’s pace dropped to around 130 km/h (81 mph). According to India’s former bowling coach Venkatesh Prasad, Sharma is among the most dedicated bowlers in India’s setup.</p><p>Ishant Sharma had problems during his bowling action. The former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh was able to identify the problems with Sharma. However, he was dedicated and worked hard for his problems during the game to improve and completely go away. The coach as well as the former players and many other people did help him improve his bowling style.</p><h2><span id=Ishant_Sharma_8211_Relationship_Status>Ishant Sharma – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Ishant has a wife whose name is <strong>Pratima Singh.</strong> They tied the knot on December 9, 2016.
