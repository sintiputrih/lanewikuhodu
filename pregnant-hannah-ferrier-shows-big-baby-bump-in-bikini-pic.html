I don’t know why they call it morning sickness. It’s very strange because it’s not. It’s all day. So not being able to control that and not being able to feel better, [made] my normal life difficult.”</span></p><p class=x_p1><span class=x_s1>The former chief stewardess<a href=#> gave her partner, <strong>Josh</strong>, a sweet shout-out</a> last month, saying he’s doted on her “without batting an eyelid.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_p1><span class=x_s1>Ferrier explained in August: “I actually got a little teary the other day because I think I’ve really enjoyed my pregnancy journey so much because of him.
