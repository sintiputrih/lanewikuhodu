He also sued Hilton's family, accusing them of tarnishing his image after they suggested he exploited her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/efb8f1e2cd18ebbc3efe3e062801cb29.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Paris Hilton at the Beverly Wilshire Four Seasons Hotel on March 4, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Hilton also sued the company that released the tape, claiming it violated her privacy and caused her emotional distress. However, in 2004, Salomon started distributing the tape himself via Red Light District, an adult film company.</p><p class=dh>He titled the video "One Night in Paris." He also dropped his lawsuit against Hilton's family after a court dismissed her privacy lawsuit. In a 2004 interview with ABC News, Salomon shed more light on how he and Hilton decided on making the tape, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna4374474>saying:</a></p><p class=dh>"It was just, you know, very light.

He also claimed fraud was the reason.</strong></h3><p class=dh>Despite the dark cloud that seemed to hover over Hilton's life and career after the tape's release, it ended up taking her career to greater heights and seemed to be the sort of publicity<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/downloads-are-a-girls-best-friend-20040710-gdy7i2.html> she needed.</a></p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MARRIAGE TO SHANNEN DOHERTY</strong></p><p class=dh>In 2002, Salomon tied the knot with Doherty. It marked his second marriage after his first marriage with actress Elizabeth Daily ended in divorce in 2000, after five years as a couple. Salomon and Daily share two daughters, Hunter, born in 1996, and Tyson, born in 1998.</p><p class=dh>While the former couple's marriage lasted five years, the same could not be said about Salomon and Doherty's union. Their marriage was annulled in 2003, nine months after they tied the knot.</p><p class=dh>Following the scandal surrounding Salomon's sex tape with Hilton, Doherty offered her take on the controversy. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/660566/Shannen-Doherty-slams-exs-sex-tape>slammed the tape</a> and termed what her ex-husband did to Hilton as disgusting.</p><p class=dh>Despite not being pleased about the sex tape, Doherty had no regrets about her relationship with Salomon. She admitted to not making the best choices in men but claimed that something he provided amazed her.</p><p class=dh>Doherty said no one had ever made her laugh the way Salomon did, adding that she was madly in love with him. She further described their marriage as hard, adding that it was heart-crushing when it ended.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ANDERSON WEDS RICK SALOMON</strong></p><p class=dh>Following the annulment of his marriage with Doherty, Salomon's next marriage was to actress Pamela Anderson in 2007.
