Then, in 1998 the network went through a total rebrand and began to focus on “reality” shows. While there is no doubt that TLC is the home to many shows that people care deeply about, including <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a>, it could be argued that viewers are more invested in My 600-Lb Life. After all, each episode of 90 Day Fiancé focuses on someone who is in a battle for their life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Things TLC Execs Forbid Their "Stars" From Doing</a></span></p><p>Over the years, it has become clear that <a href=#>some of the things that happen during episodes of My 600-lb Life are fake</a>. On the other hand, it is a fact that the people who appear on the show are at a major fork in the road. Considering that the stakes for everyone who goes on My 600-lb Life are so high, it makes perfect sense that many viewers care deeply about what happens to the people who go on the show. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, what are some of the cast of My 600-lb Life up to in 2022?</p><h2 id=justin-mcswain-has-struggled-to-keep-off-the-weight-but-he-is-succeeding><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Justin McSwain Has Struggled To Keep Off The Weight But He Is Succeeding</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2019, My 600-lb Life fans were introduced to a resident of South Caroline named Justin McSwain and he needed Dr. Nowzaradan’s help as he weighed in at almost 700 pounds. After undergoing surgery, McSwain managed to shed so much weight that he wound up undergoing skin removal surgery. On social media, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McSwain wrote about his struggles to keep the weight off</a> but there is no doubt that he is in much better shape today than when he met Dr. Now. "Through quarantine and feelings of being trapped again it’s been even harder to maintain than it was to lose, and though it’s far from easy and I do fluctuate, I am still further along than I ever thought possible.

Of course, there is no way to know how LaShaee’s life would have gone if she didn’t get help. Still, the Daily Mail reported that LaShaee, who became a transgender man, lost nearly 500 pounds through hard work and surgical help. Sadly, despite transforming their body and life, LaShaee’s brother Wayne Compton confirmed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Destinee passed away in February of 2022</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>My 600-lb Life: 15 Odd (But True) Facts About Making The TLC Show</a></span></p><h2 id=amber-rachdi-became-a-social-media-influencer><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Amber Rachdi Became A Social Media Influencer</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout most of entertainment history, celebrities were things like atheletes, actors, and musicians. In this day and age, it is common for people to <a href=#>become famous as a result of being “reality” stars</a> and social media influencers. Amazingly enough, Amber Rachdi falls under both of those categories. After all, Rachdi first became famous when she appeared during the third season of My 600-lb Life and she became an influencer after losing lots of weight and joining Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p><h2 id=penny-saeger-has-refused-to-get-with-the-program><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Penny Saeger Has Refused To Get With The Program</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, fans of My 600-lb Life have become familiar with the process that the show’s stars have to go through to change their lives. During Penny Saeger’s episode of the show, she rebelled against the process by refusing to alter her diet the way Dr. Now instructed her to. Ultimately, it took Saeger a year to lose enough weight to undergo gastric bypass surgery. Worse yet, once Saeger had the surgery, she still refused to follow dietary instructions which resulted in her reportedly gaining weight back after undergoing the knife. As of 2022, Saeger no longer interacts with the public in any way so there is no way to know exactly what she is up to. That said, there is no indication whatsoever that Saeger has changed her ways and gotten healthier.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'My 600-lb Life': The Tragic Truth The Show Doesn't Tell Us</a></span></p><h2 id=marla-mccants-is-looking-great-but-she-isn-rsquo-t-a-fan-of-my-600-lb-life><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Marla McCants Is Looking Great But She Isn’t A Fan Of My 600-lb Life</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the third season of My 600-lb Life, Nashville’s Marla McCants was revealed to weigh a staggering and life-threatening 800 pounds. By the end of her episode, McCants had already dropped down to 534 pounds thanks to lifestyle changes and Dr. Now’s help. In the years since her episode aired, McCants has done a great job staying the course and she looks very healthy in 2022. On top of that, in 2022 McCants has been very dedicated to L.O.S.S., a charity that helps people cope with grief and embrace theur spirituality. Even though My 600-lb Life played a major role in her transformation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCants has accused the show’s producers of fakery and unethical behavior</a>.</p><h2 id=christina-phllips-has-become-a-mother><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Christina Phllips Has Become A Mother</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most people who’ve appeared on My 600-lb Life, the biggest fear has been regaining the weight they lost. When it comes to Christina Phillips, however, she actually had the opposite problem. The reason for that is that Phillips has revealed that she was so afraid of putting the weight back on after dropping to 183 pounds that she struggled with anorexia. Now that it has been years since she appeared on My 600-Lb Life, Phillips seems to be avoiding the spotlight. However, it is known that Phillips went under skin removal surgery and she is trying to enjoy her life to the fullest now that she can get around easily. Most notably, Phillips revealed on Instagram that she has become a mother.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>My 600 Pound Life: 20 Things Execs Want To Keep Hush Hush</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2glWKwor%2FTZqafZZ2uend8j2ajm2WcnrOmecCrnGacn567qHnIp2RraGJnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
