With an impressive octa-core Snapdragon 835 CPU and a whopping 6GB of RAM, it packs some serious hardware within a sleek, phablet form factor.</p><p>This could unfortunately be one of the last Notes. Recent reports have suggested Samsung could soon discontinue the line in favor of its foldable devices. If that’s the case, you’ll want to safeguard yours as much as possible. Luckily, we’ve tested out some of the best Note 8 cases to keep your <a href=# data-injected=1>smartphone</a> from the elements and unwanted impacts. A few even have special features to heighten your mobile experience. Here are our favorites.</p><h2>Ghostek Atomic Slim Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>If you want a futuristic-looking case that offers some of the best protection around for your Note 8, look no further than Ghostek’s Atomic Slim case. Its striking design incorporates silvery red trim with a transparent back, so you can continue to show off the Note 8’s rear camera module. As far as protection goes, it combines strong (yet lightweight) aluminum with a thin inner skin made of TPU (a type of plastic), providing a mix of flexibility and resilience. There’s also an anti-slip handgrip, a scratch-resistant back, and a lifted bumper to protect the phone’s screen. Best of all, the case has been drop-tested to 12 feet, so you can drop it out of first-floor windows to your heart’s content. Supports wireless charging.</p><h2>Samsung Rugged Military Grade Protective Cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Most rugged armor-style cases tend to look slightly over-the-top, yet this official Note 8 case from Samsung is pretty much as tasteful as you can get while still turning your phone into a small tank. It looks surprisingly stylish despite its ridged design and grainy surfaces, with the case fitting the phone very snugly. Importantly, it has been drop and impact-tested to U.S MIL-STD-810G standards, meaning it’s capable of withstanding falls from significant heights. If that weren’t enough, the built-in kickstand means you can watch media and speak to friends with no hands, making it highly functional.</p><h2>Noreve Tradition E Leather Cover</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Leather is a durable material that ages gracefully and feels good in the hand. French case maker Noreve uses the finest leather, and this is the most minimal case it offers. A simple thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) shell wrapped in leather hugs your Note 8 and wards off scratches and bumps. There are generous openings for the buttons and the top and bottom are left open, and while the rim of the case does extend beyond the screen, we wouldn’t rely on this one for rugged protection. You can opt for different leather grains in a wide range of colors. Prices can rise significantly as you go for Noreve’s top-tier materials, but the quality is excellent.</p><h2 id=title class="a-size-large a-spacing-none"><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">ProCase Wallet Flip Case</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>ProCase has a solid reputation for developing protective cases and organizers for all types of devices. The best of both worlds comes together with this folding flip case for the Note 8. A book-like enclosure made of genuine leather keeps your phone in place with a hardshell case that fits snugly. An inside flap has three separate slots to hold cards and a large full-length pocket for cash. Moreover, you can use it as a kickstand to prop your phone up in landscape orientation. The nature of the design provides privacy with the ability to cover the Note 8’s always-on display, should you have it activated. We love the classic look of the brown color, but it’s also available in black and red.</p><h2>RhinoShield CrashGuard Bumper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>We’re big fans of minimalist cases that don’t completely mask your phone’s original design and this RhinoShield bumper fits nicely in that category. It’s quite thick, but it’s just a frame that extends from front to back to ensure your Note 8 won’t make contact with the ground if dropped. The bumper is strong enough to guard against falls of up to 12 feet. We used one with our Note 5 for many months and it survived more than one fall unscathed. The port openings are oversized for easy access and the button covers work well, once they’ve loosened a bit.</p><h2>Tech21 Evo Tactical Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Having seen <a href=#>tech21’s testing methods</a> first hand, we know they take drop protection very seriously. The Evo Tactical has a clever design that goes around the frame of your Note 8, effectively providing three layers of protection and ensuring your phone can survive drops of up to 10 feet without a mark. Despite this level of protection, the case is fairly thin and light. There are large openings for easy access to ports, cameras, and other features. You’ll also find button covers and raised edges on top and bottom to protect the screen. Although it just comes in black, Tech21 has thrown in a design flourish on the back with a geometric pattern that’s also textured to create an interesting look and enhance your grip.</p><h2>Olixar FlexiCover Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Things don’t get much simpler than this clear, soft-gel case from Olixar. It’s very slim, so it won’t provide much in the way of drop protection, but its front and back coverage should ward off scratches and dirt. The full-body protection still leaves perfect fit openings for all your phone’s ports, speakers, and cameras to use your Note 8 without any sort of hindrance. A non-slip coating also provides extra grip, meaning your phone is less likely to slip from your grasp when using this case.</p><h2>Speck Presidio Grip Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It’s tough to find cases that combine style and reliability with a clever design like this one. This is a protective case that combines a hard polycarbonate shell with a shock-absorbing rubber material that will keep your Note 8 safe from falls of up to 10 feet. The flexible material is also used to create a series of ridges on the outside which give it an interesting look, but, perhaps more importantly, seriously improve your g<span>rip. This&nbsp;</span><span><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">Graphite Grey&nbsp;</span><span>version </span>really lends</span> itself to showcasing the case’s design, but it’s also available in several other colors.</p><h2>Case-Mate Tough Clear Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Want more peace of mind without masking Samsung’s gorgeous design? Case-Mate’s Tough Clear case can do exactly that by adding scratch resistance and impressive drop protection on falls from up to 10 feet. The crystal clear case has flexible sides for an improved grip in the hand on the sizable Note 8. There’s also extra cushioning in the corners specifically to soften the impact of bumps and falls at odd angles. A metallic finish on integrated button coverings brings a bit of unique flair to your phone as well. It’s ultimately a slim and subtle case that will still provide essential protection.</p><h2>Moment Galaxy Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The Note 8 is a phone worth keeping for years. That kind of commitment can make features like the camera feel outdated as new phones continue to debut. That’s where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moment</a> comes in. Their modular case system lets you attach a collection of lenses and filters to the Note 8’s cameras for extra versatility. There’s also a slot at the bottom of the case to attach a wrist strap for quick access to the phone while shooting a lot of photos or videos. You’ll get solid protection with a polycarbonate frame wrapped in a rubberized outer shell that improves grip. It’s rated for drops up to six feet onto hardwood and has a raised front edge to protect your screen. U.S.-sourced walnut makes up the stylish inlay in this featured model (lens not included). There’s also a version of the case with a black canvas inlay.</p><h2>Spigen Rugged Armor Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>This flexible TPU case is easy to fit and offers enough protection to safeguard your Note 8 from drop damage if it takes a tumble from pocket height. The cutouts are exactly right and the button covers have a nice feel to them, with a textured finish on the power key helping it to stand out. The top and bottom sides extend out from your phone’s screen to safeguard against scratches and cracks. What really makes this case is the carbon fiber panels on the back and the gloss accents which elevate the overall look, transforming an affordable TPU case into something a bit more stylish.</span></p><h2>UAG Monarch Series Case</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>If you need extra strong protection for your Galaxy Note 8, you will probably take a liking to the cases from Urban Armor Gear. The Monarch Series sports the usual industrial UAG look, adding leather panels and alloy metal highlights to the lightweight, yet sturdy plastic frame. This case passed <a href=#>military drop-test standards</a></span><span>, with flying colors, so rest assured your Note 8 is safe if it happens to take a tumble. You’ll have no problem finding and protecting your buttons with large, raised coverings, and your battery and audio ports will be perfectly visible and unobstructed. You can rest assured that no part of your phone will be exposed to direct contact if you drop it because its surfaces are thick and robust with corners that jut out on all sides. This Note 8 case doesn’t interfere with </span>Samsung Pay<span> or the fast wireless charging.</span></p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVforyjtcueZpudo6l6qK3Lmq%2ByZZ6kwaZ5l2aamquVqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
