In a fully mature leatherback, one of the world’s largest turtle species, that’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eight whole feet</a> of slimy skewers to contend with.</p><p>Why the spines? Land turtles, after all, don’t have an armory in their throats; they’re able to use esophageal muscles to move their food, just like humans do.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229080 alt="Snapping Turtle Mouth" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/snapping-turtle-mouth.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229080 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pixabay</span><span class=caption-body>The mouth of a snapping turtle — a land turtle who doesn’t need the papillae that line many sea turtles’ throats.</span></p><p>The trouble is that sea turtles don’t have the luxury of swallowing their food on dry land. Every time a sea turtle opens its mouth, water gushes in — and pours out, carrying any loose debris with it, including the sea turtle’s last meal.</p><p>Or it would, if the food weren’t tucked safely between the sharp papillae, slowly moving deeper and deeper into the turtle’s digestive system.</p><p>The spines inside a sea turtle’s mouth also protect it from dangerous prey; jellyfish are the leatherback’s favorite snack, and it’s imperative that the turtle’s insides are shielded from stings by the hard spikes.</p><p>So once jellyfish, crustaceans, and sea grasses go in, they don’t come back out. That is, not unless the turtle ends up on the operating table.</p><h2>The Disturbing Truth Turtle Necropsies Reveal</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229081 alt="Leatherback Turtle Papillae" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/leatherback-turtle-papillae.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229081 class=wp-caption-text>The hard papillae that line a leatherback sea turtle’s esophagus, as pictured during a necropsy.</p><p>Laura Castanon, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI), took the above video during a post-mortem examination of a loggerhead sea turtle, a big-headed, hard-shelled species that typically reaches two to three feet in length.</p><p>Castanon was investigating how low temperatures affect the loggerhead’s internal organs, but the WHOI’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turtle dissections</a> — a weekly occurrence — attract a range of curious scientists and undergrads, and not just because of the sea turtles’ unusual mouths.</p><p>Their subjects are sea turtles who didn’t make it, despite the best efforts of the volunteers who regularly comb winter Massachusetts beaches in search of cold-stunned creatures. Cape Cod typically sees around 600 stranded turtles every year, a result of the migrating turtles’ difficulty navigating the inlet.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229082 alt="Cape Cod" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/cape-cod.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229082 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Flickr / NASA Goddard Space Flight Center</span><span class=caption-body>Cape Cod, where hundreds of sea turtles are stranded every year.</span></p><p>Instead of continuing south to warmer waters, the sea turtles get confused while circumnavigating the bay and come to rest instead in brutally cold Atlantic currents. Their systems shut down as they’re forced to the shore — where volunteers are ready to perform turtle triage.</p><p>Many turtles are successfully revived, rehabilitated, and released after a spell in the warm waters of the nearby New England Aquarium.</p><p>But where rescuers fail, science steps in to learn what it can from the bodies — always hoping that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turtle necropsies</a> will lead to better information about the threats endangered sea turtles face.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-229083 alt="Sea Turtle Rescue" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/sea-turtle-rescue.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-229083 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Coast Guard Compass Archive / Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Tyler McGuinness</span><span class=caption-body>Coast Guard Petty Officer 3rd Class Sarah Welvaert releases a Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle into the Atlantic Ocean Feb. 3, 2017.</span></p><p>Unsurprisingly, humans rank among the gravest hazards.</p><p>The sea turtles’ spiny digestive tracts tell a sad story. In between shreds of sea plants, pieces of jellyfish, and snail bits are plastic fragments: torn balloons, the bands from commercial lobster claws, and scraps of shopping bags.</p><p>The dissection teams at WHOI know what’s really scary about the mouths of sea turtles: the evidence they contain of an increasingly plastic ocean — a danger to sea life everywhere.</p><p>For more interesting turtles, check out the rare <a href=#>albino sea turtle</a> recently found on a beach in Australia.
