It’s simple: The formula utilizes ingredients that can help “energize” your skin by reinvigorating it to bring back life it may have lost over the years. As we get older, or skin loses elasticity and the proper natural support it requires to stay taut and firm. It’s not just about building up more collagen into your skin, which is an ingredient commonly used in anti-aging products. It’s about giving your skin cells the energy they need to tighten back up and support the production of collagen and elastin that the skin has been lacking.</p><p>That’s where Marine-Derived Bacillus Ferment comes into play! The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Uplift Firming Serum</a> relies on this ingredient, sourced from below the ocean’s surface, to help your skin restore itself back to its youthful glory! Thanks to this handy hack in the serum’s formula, you may see impressive results in as little as 30 minutes. Reviewers are proudly standing behind this claim: They note their skin instantly feels “tighter, lifted, more hydrated,” which is always the ultimate goal. Over time, the fine lines can disappear and deeper wrinkles may look significantly less prominent — all from this one product!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/City-Beauty.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Uplift Firming Serum</a> (originally $85) on sale with free shipping for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$59</a> at City Beauty — online exclusive offer!</strong></p><p>Shoppers are thrilled, reporting that their skin looks “the way it did 10-15 years ago”!
