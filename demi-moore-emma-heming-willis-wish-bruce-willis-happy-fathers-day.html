Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, from his marriage to Moore, 61. He shares Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10, with Emma, 45. He became a grandparent last April when Rumer and partner <strong>Derek Thomas</strong> welcomed their daughter, Louetta. His daughters have previously <a href=#>lauded the action star’s skill</a> at raising girls.</p><p>“He’s a girl dad, through and through. I saw him with my sisters, my little sisters,” Rumer told Today&nbsp;hosts <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> and <strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong> in May. “Honestly, seeing them [Bruce and Moore] with her, it almost unlocks all of these childhood memories because being a grandparent, I think, is the best. They have all of the love and joy without any of the responsibilities. They get to just spoil her.”</p><p>Bruce <a href=#>retired from acting in 2022</a> after revealing his struggle with the brain disorder aphasia. In February 2023, the family revealed that Bruce had been <a href=#>diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia</a>, an incurable condition that impairs speech and motor skills. According to insiders who spoke to Us in December, handling Bruce’s diagnosis has <a href=#>brought the entire family closer together</a>.</p><p>“They’re all there all the time,” the source said. “Once Bruce was diagnosed, everyone came together to keep his memory of the family intact and to be there as a constant reminder [that they] love him. [Everything] revolves around him.”</p><p>Another source added, “Bruce has around-the-clock care, but at least one family member is always with him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Rumer said her dad was “really good” when <a href=#>speaking to Us Weekly</a> at the Beverly Hills Film Festival in May. Rumer hoped that her family’s openness about working through her father’s diagnosis as a unit would help others struggling with the same issues.</p><p>​“I feel like that’s been so evident in the transparency with which we’ve been sharing,” she said. “If sharing our experience, strength, hope and whatever comes forward as a family, if that can bring any sort of hope or comfort to someone else who’s experiencing that, then to me that’s everything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadnZ2eeq67zqucZp2doq5utMSmoKefXay2rbjIrGSwoaOdeqO%2B1JycZq%2BZobmqv4yhmKmoqWKzosDHnqmsZZSWxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
