One of the best parts of Nickelodeon’s annual <a href=#>Kids’ Choice Awards</a>&nbsp;is seeing A-list stars covered in the network’s <a href=#>signature neon-green goo</a>.</p><p>Fans have watched everyone from <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>JoJo Siwa</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Orlando Bloom</strong></a> be sprayed with the gooey substance. <a href=#><strong>Halle Berry</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>John Cena</strong></a> and even <a href=#><strong>Harrison Ford</strong></a> have fallen victim to the iconic slime session.</p><p>“You’re never exactly ready for it, it’s always a surprise,” <a href=#>Kids’ Choice Awards</a> executive producer <strong>Jay Schmalholz</strong> told <a href=#>TVInsider</a> in March 2018 of the show’s most memorable prank. “It does get in everywhere — you’ll be finding it for a couple of weeks. But it’s super fun. You can’t help but smile and feel like a little kid.”</p><p>Schmalholz revealed the best part about sliming someone is watching the star’s reactions. “The aftermath is fantastic, watching them get de-slimed,” he said. “We go through thousands and thousands of towels. It is absolutely an art form. We’ve got Slime Masters who have gotten really good at it.”</p><p>After winning <a href=#>Favorite Butt-Kicker in March 2019</a>, Pratt was slimed with honor during his <a href=#>acceptance speech</a>. “There’s a lot of fun. There’s a lot of slime,” he said before the green goo spurted at him. “Well, it’s still worth it!”</p><p>He later thanked his fans for their votes via Instagram, joking, “Now [if] you’ll excuse me I’ve got slim to clean out from deep within my nostrils.”</p><p>When <a href=#><strong>Camila Cabello</strong></a> and boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Shawn Mendes</strong></a> took home <a href=#>the orange blimp trophy for Favorite Musical Collaboration</a> the next year, they were unable to get slimed because the show was done virtually amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>“This is so cool! I literally have watched the Kids’ Choice Awards for forever. I wish we were there to get slimed,” the Canadian crooner said in May 2020.</p><p>The former Fifth Harmony singer, however, made it clear the couple would be honoring the tradition by creating a homemade version of the goo. “We love you. Thank you so much for voting. We’re going to make organic slime and slime ourselves,” she said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Siwa, on the other hand, didn’t let the pandemic restrictions keep her from <a href=#>getting slimed at home in May 2020</a>. In fact, she got the green substance all over her house while celebrating Slime Day in honor of her Favorite Social Music Star win.</p><p>Scroll down to see which stars have been slimed and who could be next!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BowaK%2B0maenqyknruoedKloKadlGK7qq%2FKnqOonJWku263yJ2qZpuYpLaksYyarpqqlKh6c3yQbGlpa18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
