She’s joined by a number of talented stars, including Fifty Shades of Grey‘s Jamie Dornan, RRR‘s Alia Bhatt, and Death on the Nile‘s Sophie Okonedo. Even in such illustrious company, however, one name is stirring up more interest than any other, as people gush over the talented <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jing Lusi</a></strong>.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-jing-lusi data-injectable=false>Who is Jing Lusi?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>Jing Lusi is far from the most well-known name to appear in Heart of Stone, but that might change with the film’s official release on Netflix. Lusi is among the flick’s more recent stars, with just a handful of appearances proceeding her spot among the film’s stacked cast, but new viewers are already rushing to join her fan club.</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>That’s largely due to Lusi’s undeniable charm in the film, and across television and film appearances. The 38-year-old was born in Shanghai, but by the age of five was making the transition to the U.K. From there, she collected several degrees, and — in 2012 — earned her breakout role in British medical drama Holby City.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>The show launched Lusi into a career in the spotlight, and she’s been thriving ever since. In between roles on television and film, she somehow finds time to hone her comedic skills and host the Chinese New Year celebrations in&nbsp;Trafalgar Square. These days, she’s too busy with her work on the big and small screen to find time for much else, but that’s great news for the star’s incoming fans.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jing Lusi’s previous roles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Jing_Lusi_Red_Notice.jpg><p data-characters=636 data-current-count=936 data-injectable=true>People with an eye on British television have almost certainly seen Lusi before, but the rest of us might need a fresh introduction. She’s appeared in several major projects over the years, with lengthy stints on the aforementioned Holby City as well as Bob the Builder and Zapped, but her introduction to worldwide audiences took a while. She first broke onto the scene in 2012, but it wasn’t until 2015’s Survivor that she really started to break into the mainstream. Her status as a star was cemented a few years later, with 2018’s Crazy Rich Asians and SAS: Red Notice, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>With her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appearance in Heart of Stone</a>, Lusi is simply reminding audiences of how much we’d like to see more of her. And — in great news for fans — more Lusi appearances are slated for the future. Following Heart of Stone Lusi is poised to appear in 2024’s Argylle, another spy thriller featuring Lusi alongside Henry Cavill, Bryce Dallas Howard, and&nbsp;Samuel L. Jackson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmopmjtG641KygZp6ipLputMSaqa1ln5t6tMDOp5xmmZ6Zeri0xKucZqCRq7Juxc6uZKydlaN6qbHRZpmenp%2BnsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
