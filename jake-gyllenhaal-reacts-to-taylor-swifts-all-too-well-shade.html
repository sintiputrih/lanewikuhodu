The new 10-minute version plus the addition of a short film has fans in utter shock and disbelief.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swifties have suspected that the song written in 2012 may have been about her three-month <a href=#>relationship with actor Jake Gyllenhaal</a>... and they were correct.</p><p>The short film <a href=#>starred Dylan O'Brien and Sadie Sink</a> and was written and directed by Taylor herself. The video showed the ins and outs of Taylor's perspective during their fling and how heartbroken she was when it ended.</p><p>There were so many little ironies and meaningful symbols it was truly a cinematic masterpiece.</p><p>Her new lyrics "I'll get older but your lovers stay my age" and "You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine / and that made me want to die," prove even more that the song is about Jake.</p><p>When Taylor and Jake dated they were nine years apart, she turned 21 and he was 30, and their age difference was <a href=#>allegedly a big reason for their split</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Anne Hathaway Reportedly Comforted Taylor Swift After Her Split From Jake Gyllenhaal</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-all-too-well-the-short-film>Taylor Swift All Too Well: The Short Film</h2><p>The storyline spoke to many Taylor Swift fans who have gone through a similar relationship. However, it did not speak so well to Jake Gyllenhaal.</p><p>"Jake has no interest in any of it," the insider shares. "He doesn't read gossip or pay any attention to that." The source adds of Jake, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He's living his life and focused on himself</a>. He's ignoring all of the noise."</p><p>His bestie Ryan Reynolds has been shown singing along and supporting Taylor Swift during her Saturday Night Live performance. This rubbed fans the wrong way and hopefully, Gyllenhaal doesn't take it too personally.</p><p>His wife, Blake Lively, is part of Taylor's next project so it seems highly likely that <a href=#>he is just supporting Blake</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>‘All Too Well’: John Mayer Replies To Angry Swiftie Chosen At Random</a></span></p><h2 id=blake-and-ryan-watching-taylor-on-snl>Blake And Ryan Watching Taylor On SNL</h2><p>Ryan is shown singing along to Taylor's "All Too Well" performance.</p><p>Taylor Swift's new music video for her song "I Bet You Think About Me," <a href=#>directed by Blake Lively</a> debuted on Monday.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip' Kenya And Ramona Fight On Day One</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqOVYrS6uMuepaGZkaF6s7HAnKusZaSkerWt2KWmq2WjrLanwNJmmKWkXam8sHnWnqOlZaOdrqWxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
