The Salt Of The Earth is truly proficient when it comes to cutting a promo as well. Many believed MJF was going to turn babyface a while ago and it seems AEW did have plans for that as well.</p><p>During the AEW All Out media scrum, Chris Jericho stated&nbsp;<a href=#>that he believes MJF would become one of the top babyfaces in AEW</a>. Afterwards, MJF’s mannerisms seemed as if he was actually going to turn babyface as well.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t happen as MJF is a full-blown heel as the AEW World Champion. According to <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>, Dave Meltzer detailed the scrapped plans AEW had to turn MJF into a babyface.</p><p>Multiple people have noted to us in the past week that there was discussions regarding having MJF be the lead face coming out of Full Gear. It was my intuition because the company needed a new hot babyface to really around and making a top babyface today is far harder than a top heel.</p><p>That said, Tony Khan made the call and at this point the absolute worst idea would be to turn MJF face now because that window has closed at least for many more months down the line. It might have missed its peak and all, but who can say where things will be in six months or a year.”</p><p>MJF is set to defend his AEW World Championship against Ricky Starks at AEW Dynamite: Winter Is Coming next week. We will have to wait and see how MJF will fare in his first title defense.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on MJF as a babyface in the future?
