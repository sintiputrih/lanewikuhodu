And even when the spark fails to materialize between them, Francesca continues to give Dom a chance. Eventually, though, when Francesca decides to see if there's anything between her and real-life friend Damian, her relationship with Dom goes south.</p><p>This leads him on a quest to either decide to leave on his own terms, strike up a new romance, or wait for a new arrival. While viewers are rooting for Dom and his in-show female bestie <a href=#>Ines</a> to be together, he doesn't seem to see her that way. At least, not yet. So, are Dom and Ines dating now, after Perfect Match? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Dom and Ines dating after 'Perfect Match'?</h2><p>When Ines tells Dom that she likes him on Perfect Match, he is totally clueless. He believed they were just friends up until that point And they are, but Ines expresses that she has deeper feelings for him. Unfortunately, it's too late and Dom is already all in with Georgia. But outside of Perfect Match, things may be different.</p><p>In February 2023, Ines shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> photos of a trip to California for Super Bowl weekend. In a video on the post, you can see Dom in the background. And when a follower commented, asking Ines if she and Dom are "besties or romantic," Ines replied with three heart emojis.</p><p>And when the cast attended a Your Place or Mine movie premiere event, Ines and Dom posed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photos</a> with just the two of them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now I just want Dom and Ines to end up together because they seem like the only two people there who want to make an actual connection with someone. <a href=#>#PerfectMatch</a></p>â€” angstandennui (@angstandennui) <a href=#>February 14, 2023</a></figure><p>So there's a good chance that Dom and Ines are together. If they aren't, they're sure to break a lot of fans' hearts. Despite Dom and Georgia having a cute romance right now on the show, many viewers see Dom and Ines as endgame. And since the season isn't over yet, don't totally count that out.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dom and Francesca had a difficult breakup on 'Perfect Match.'</h2><p>When Dom and Frencesca win a compatibility competition, they prove how right they could be for each other. Part of their prize is getting to choose the next arrivals. Francesca picks Damian, whom she once flirted with outside of <a href=#>the show</a>. She goes on a date with him and realizes that they have more chemistry than she and Dom ever had.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @dontcalldom</a></figure><p>It's a blindside for Dom.</p><p>He recently spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Narcity</a> about the memorable moment and how he initially felt a "spark" with Francesca. So when she moved on with Damian, it was out of left field for him.</p><p>"You might say I was very naive," he admitted to the outlet. "But you know, I trusted her and she told me I could trust her."</p><p>Perhaps the best thing Dom needs to move on from the ordeal is dating his Perfect Match bestie, Ines. It's certainly what viewers want at this point.</p><p>Watch Perfect Match on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbyuecCnm2ahnprAbrzEq52em6RiuqLAwqFknZmknruo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
