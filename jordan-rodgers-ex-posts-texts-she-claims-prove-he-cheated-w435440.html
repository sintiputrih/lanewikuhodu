She alleges Rodgers, 27, purchased the blooms for his mistress in June 2014. The receipt reads: “Happy Birthday To My Favorite Bella. Miss You Can’t Wait To See That Beautiful Smile Again. From, Your Favorite Football Player Wanna-Be Actor.”</p><p>“The Original Rose: The receipt for a giant bouquet of roses Jordan bought for the girl he cheated on me with in Louisiana. (The first of many I would later find out about),” Farrar captioned the Instagram post. “He met her while shooting <i>Pitch Perfect 2</i> (he was deep in the background pretending to be one of the Green Bay Packers — the closest he’s ever been to making an NFL team). And for the devil’s advocate I’ve included screenshots of texts with dates to show we were a couple when he bought his favorite Bella some very special roses. And also one of the many, many texts he sent after we broke up.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=750 height=1101 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In a follow-up Instagram post, the personal trainer shared three alleged screenshots of text message exchanges she claims she had with the former football player. In the texts — which are dated June 26, 2014, the same time period that Rodgers allegedly purchased the bouquet of flowers — Farrar argues with Rodgers for not texting her the night before.</p><p>“Sooo no text from u last night when u got home.. How come? … Don’t think I would have appreciated a text? … Really sincere,” she allegedly wrote, to which Rodgers replied, “My bad … Like I said it was a long night.”</p><p>More than a month later, the aspiring sports broadcaster allegedly sent Farrar a series of texts, which she seemingly ignored, writing, “How do you not respond to any of that all day?? You really have no feelings for me anymore do you? I don’t get it britt. I can’t sleep I can’t eat, I’m losing a s–t load of weight I’m depressed. I’m beating myself up enough about this already. Please just talk to me.”</p><p>The next day, Rodgers reportedly sent another message: “Good morning love of my life. Just letting you know I’m not giving up.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt width=575 height=852 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As <i>Us Weekly</i> previously reported, Farrar previously <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> on Thursday, August 18, when she called her ex a “prolific liar and cheater” in a since-deleted post. She also claimed he was seeking fame by being one of <b><a href=#>JoJo Fletcher</a></b>’s suitors on season 12 of <i>The Bachelorette</i>. (As fans know, Fletcher chose Rodgers as the winner and they are now engaged.)</p><p>Earlier this month, the former athlete <a href=#>slammed his ex’s claims</a> during a press conference, where he called her allegations “really harsh and very untrue.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp6KZrq950aiboJ2iqHqmxIyppqyso2LBpsTTrGSsoJVisK2tyKaqZqiipMOmeceeZJyglZbBprCMsGtsbWRpfXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
