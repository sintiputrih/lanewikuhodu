The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) connects the jaw to the bones of the skull, and, if irritated, can cause pain. It could be treated with physical therapy, medications or bite guards.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“My face completely changed,” Frankel added of the apparently unintentional transformation.</p><p>Frankel went on to acknowledge that she did look a bit <a href=#>different at the recent <i>RHONY</i> reunion.</a> “I looked at the reunion and my eyes — the little trick that actually [makeup artist] Kristofer Buckle taught Maryana, my makeup artist, is when you put your eyelashes on, put the ends up a little bit, and it makes your eyes look a little more out. So they don’t go down,” she explained. “But, no, I have not. I have not had any plastic surgery.”</p><p>Back in May, Frankel similarly denied that she’s had plastic surgery during an interview with the <i>Daily Mail.</i> She did, however, admit to getting Botox on other places on her face besides her jaw. “I don’t do it religiously,” she said at the time. “Maybe once a year when I think of it, I’ll be like, ‘Oh, I look like a Shar-Pei, let me do that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtedOao6SrXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2Gacsaiclravv4yhnKtlo52%2FqrrKoqWgZZqWxG7Dk2xvbnFiZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
