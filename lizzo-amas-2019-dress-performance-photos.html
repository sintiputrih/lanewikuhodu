The three-time nominee tonight performed her song “Jerome” during the telecast and looked amazing in a ruffled, rose-colored gown. As she belted the tune, lights dazzled around the singer during her emotional ballad. Lizzo belted lyrics like, “I never said that you wasn’t attractive your style and that beard, don’t get me distracted.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Prior to her performance, Lizzo arrived to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Music Awards</a> and stunned the red carpet! The singer took the red carpet by storm with her incredible ensemble that only she could pull off. She looked amazing in an orange, one shoulder ruffle dress that just hit above her knees. Lizzo also carried a <strong>Valentino</strong> purse, while chatting with red carpet corespondents&nbsp; about body positivity and being a superstar. The “Truth Hurts” singer sported a high ponytail with her look. Upon being asked how she felt about night, she responded with her song’s hook, “Feeling good as hell!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, Lizzo is no stranger to sporting incredible fashion trends or attending awards shows. The “Soulmate” singer posed on the October cover for Elle‘s Women in Music issue and looked so confident. She donned a Savage x Fenty corset for the fashionable photoshoot and even opened up about loving herself. “I take self-love very seriously. And I take it seriously because when I was younger, I wanted to change everything about myself,” she revealed in the raw profile. “I didn’t love who I was. And the reason I didn’t love who I was is because I was told I wasn’t lovable by the media, by [people at] school, by not seeing myself in beauty ads, by not seeing myself in television…by lack of representation.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lizzo performs "Jerome" for the first time at an awards show <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#AMAs</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/dncMfY2dhL</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>— MTV NEWS (@MTVNEWS) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>November 25, 2019</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>But now, Lizzo is making that change herself. The trailblazer has already made a huge impact on the perception of women in the music industry, as well as continuing the conversation about women’s bodies in fashion and the sizes represented in popular media. It’s a tall order for one person to take on, but Lizzo has been handling it all like a seasoned veteran! Even though it feels like the singer just burst onto the scene — she just earned a slew of Grammy nominations including Best New Artist — Lizzo has really been hustling and building her fanbase for quite some time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lizzo-amas-2019-embed-1.jpg>It’s all been paying off, though. In June, Lizzo gave an incredible performance of her hit “Truth Hurts” at the 2019 BET Awards. For her <a href=#>rousing rendition</a>, Lizzo arrived on stage at the top of a human wedding cake, dressed in a white bodice and veil like a modern day <strong>Madonna</strong>. She then took over the stage with her dancers, twerking and delivering on point choreography before whipping out her flute mid-performance. The audience was so into her performance – even <strong>Rihanna</strong> couldn’t help but bust a few moves, cheer on, and applaud the BET Award nominee.<p id=content-paragraph-9>While Lizzo’s look on the red carpet totally wowed fans, she has much more in store. The “Soulmate” songstress gave such a soulful performance and fans cannot wait to see if she walks home with an award or two (maybe even three)! Stay tuned, Lizzo fans. There is much more to come!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ye5FtZqWhqq%2B8bq3MmqpmamBmhm6w0Z6qrGWgmr%2Bnu9GmmKeblWK9qbvTqKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
