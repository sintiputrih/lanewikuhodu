But his poetry was limited to black people only and as he was tired of the limitations, he decided to expand his audience and headed to London when he was 22 years old.</p><p>Likewise, Benjamin was able to become actively involved in a workers’ cooperative in Stratford, London. This then led to the publication of his first book of poetry, “Pen Rhythm (Page One Books, 1980)”. He also stated that his mission is to fight the dead image of poetry in academia and to “take [it] everywhere” to people who do not read books, so he turned poetry readings into concert-like performances. Moreover, his other collections of poetry are “The Dread Affair: Collected Poems (1985)” and “Rasta Time in Palestine (1990)”.</p><p>Also, he was a poet in residence at the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC and sat in on the inquiry into Bloody Sunday and other cases.
