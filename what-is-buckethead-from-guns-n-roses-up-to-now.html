Fans waited for their next project to drop, however, in October, Collins put out an album called The Power of One, which didn't feature Buckethead, per <a href=#>Live for Live Music</a>. In September 2020, actor <a href=#>Viggo Mortensen gave an interview</a>&nbsp;(<a href=#>English translation</a>) about what it's like working with the GN'R guitarist, saying: "We have known each other for over 20 years. We get together once in a while and play. We don't record everything, but the music is something. ... I feel like every second of that time was worth it. He knows how to communicate intimately." Mortensen's description of Buckethead's ability to communicate is very different from what many others have experienced while working with him.</p><p>In March 2020, <a href=#>Guns N' Roses</a> manager <a href=#>Doug Goldstein gave an interview</a> about his strange way of working with the band, saying: "It wasn't bad. His behavior wasn't bad, it was head-scratching, that's the best way to put it. To hear that he can't play his leads until we build him, literally, a chicken coop in the studio for him to play in, I mean... it's just something you're not really used to dealing with." And one of Buckethead's drummers said he'd only communicate with his band's managers using his hand puppet, Herbie, saying: "[He would] wear out the managers. There's millions of dollars on the line, and they're talkin' to a *** puppet!" Thankfully, Buckethead is still communicating with his music, and released more for fans to listen to in 2020. Let's hope there's more music this year!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Fj3Ftb2xfrLWiwIyiqmaapZi4psDHnpidZZanvK55xq6lrGWeYr%2Bwv8SsZK6oXam8brrOsGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
