In 2013, for example, approximately 120 million participated over a two-month period, with more than 30 million coming together on just one day.<p>However, not all of those millions are nude. In fact, only the most highly respected holy men (known as naga sadhus, or naked saints) go without clothes (then immerse themselves in water that is sometimes freezing cold).</p><p>The time and place of the festival varies according to the Hindu calendar and certain zodiac positions. But whenever and wherever Kumbh Mela is, you can rest assured that it will be well attended.</p></span><span class=credit>Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Naked Snow Sledding Competition</h2><p>Altenberg, Germany</p><img alt="Altenberg Snow Sledding" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/altenberg-snow-sledding.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>OK, so they're not completely nude. But given that they're snow-sledding in the German mountains during winter, it's probably best that the participants in this annual competition are allowed to wear boots, gloves, helmets, and underpants.<p>Thousands come to Altenberg to watch male and female contestants from countries all across Europe race down the 300-foot hill.</p></span><span class=credit>Joern Haufe/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>The 300 Club</h2><p>South Pole, Antarctica</p><img alt="Nude Festivals At The South Pole" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/south-pole.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>This has got to be the most exclusive club on Earth.<p>The bravest researchers who stay at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station through the winter will wait for one of the few days a year when the temperature dips to -100 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, they'll get into a sauna cranked up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (that's just 12 degrees shy of boiling) for as much as ten minutes. Finally, they'll hop up from the sauna and out the station door, then run to the actual South Pole (above), about 150 yards away, and back -- wearing nothing but boots.</p><p>If you're doing the math, you'll note that these daredevils have thus endured a temperature swing of 300 degrees, hence the name of this unbelievable club.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>World Naked Bike Ride</h2><p>Various locations worldwide</p><img alt="World Naked Bike Ride" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/world-naked-bike-ride.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>The World Naked Bike Ride is exactly what it sounds like. From London to Paris to Cape Town to Washington, D.C. (above), nude cyclists have been taking over city streets since 2004, all loosely organized under the World Naked Bike Ride umbrella.<p>Why? To raise awareness about dangerous greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, and to promote human-powered transport -- like cycling -- as an alternative.</p><p>And as the events' "bare as you dare" motto suggests, nudity is welcomed but not mandated.</p></span><span class=credit>SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Beltane Fire Festival</h2><p>Edinburgh, Scotland</p><img alt="Beltane Fire Festival" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/beltane-fire-festival.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Inspired by the eponymous ancient pagan festival marking the end of winter and the beginning of summer, the modern Beltane Fire Festival lives up to its name with lots and lots of flames.<p>A daytime procession based on ancient Gaelic ritual gives way to a raucous nighttime free-for-all full of flames, body paint, and nudity.</p><p>The so-called Red Men and Women dance, brandish torches, and generally release their inner demons.</p></span><span class=credit>Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Pilwarren Maslin Beach Nude Games</h2><p>Sunnydale, Australia</p><img alt="Maslin Beach Nude Games" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/maslin-beach-nude-games.jpg> <span class=caption-body>For most of us, sack races, water balloon fights, and tug of war are the stuff of summer camp. But for the several hundred people who flock to South Australia's Pilwarren Maslin Beach Nude Games each January, it's a different story.<p>Those events -- along with frisbee throwing, donut eating, and the "Best Bum Competition" -- make up the program of these annual nude olympics, hosted by a local nudist resort.</p><p>The event was, in fact, called the Maslin Beach Nude Olympics until the Australian Olympic Committee insisted that they change it.</p></span><span class=credit>Pilwarren Maslin Beach Nude Games</span><h2 class=title>The Running of the Nudes</h2><p>Pamplona, Spain</p><img alt="Spain Running Nudes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spain-running-nudes.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Since 2002, amid the world-famous running of the bulls, PETA has organized the Running of the Nudes in protest of bullfighting.<p>According to PETA, approximately 40,000 bulls are slaughtered each year. And in order to raise awareness, activists run naked through the streets of Pamplona, brandishing signs calling for an end to bullfighting.</p><p>This year, protestors kicked things up a notch by dowsing themselves with huge quantities of fake blood.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Oblation Run</h2><p>Quezon City, Philippines</p><img alt="Oblation Run Nude Festivals" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/oblation-run.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Activism and streaking are commonplace in college life, but it's rare the two come together in such an organized way.<p>Since 1977, several dozen members of the University of the Philippines' chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity have come together at least once a year to run naked, wearing only masks (and the occasional fig leaf), across campus.</p><p>But this is far from some kind of wacky prank. This coordinated demonstration is meant to bring attention to the important national issues of the day, including political corruption and the killing of journalists.</p></span><span class=credit>JAY DIRECTO/AFP/Getty Images</span><p>After learning about these interesting nude festivals, check out some photos and facts from Scotland's <a href=#>Beltane Fire Festival</a>, where fire meets nudity.
