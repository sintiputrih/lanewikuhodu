Well, it is always a pretty good time — the future billions, the millions of users, the hoodie that won’t quit. But with The Social Network about to hit theaters, there is a massive bottleneck of muck to be raked. In this week’s New York Magazine <a href=#>cover story</a>, Mark Harris wrote about how Eduardo Saverin, Facebook’s first CFO, heavily influenced The Accidental Billionaires, the <a href=# data-track-type=product-link data-track-id=rVUQEN>book</a> by Ben Mezrich that Aaron Sorkin used create his “Rashomon-like” screenplay.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-facb09bb71030ae3c0971a6516be9637-2-0-1@published data-word-count=28>Now Silicon Alley Insider is touting newly uncovered IMs and e-mails from Zuckerberg, which have a few juicy tidbits that detail why and how Saverin got pushed out.<br></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-facb09bb71030ae3c0971a6516be9637-3-0-0@published data-word-count=97>According to the new communications, Saverin apparently used Facebook as a free platform to advertise another project he was working on called Joboozle, which pissed off Zuckerberg and makes Saverin look a little slimy. The final straw may have been that Saverin wasn’t moving fast enough on Facebook after Zuckerberg decided to drop out of Harvard and pursue the business full-time. In an IM to another Facebook partner, Zuckerberg wrote: “I maintain that he fucked himself … He was supposed to set up the company, get funding, and make a business model. He failed at all three.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-facb09bb71030ae3c0971a6516be9637-4-0-0@published data-word-count=85>The second revelation is the active role Mark Zuckerberg played in diluting Saverin’s stock in the company. From July 2004 to January 2005, in order to meet demands of potential investors, Facebook incorporated in Delaware, then acquired the old company, formed as an LLC. In that time, Saverin’s stock was diluted from 30 percent to 24 percent to less than 10 percent, with Facebook’s new COO Sean Parker and Silicon Valley bigwig Peter Thiel onboard as shareholders. Here’s an I.M. conversation between Parker and Zuckerberg:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-facb09bb71030ae3c0971a6516be9637-5-1-0@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-facb09bb71030ae3c0971a6516be9637-6-0-0@published data-word-count=27>Parker: Peter [Thiel] tried some dirty tricks.
