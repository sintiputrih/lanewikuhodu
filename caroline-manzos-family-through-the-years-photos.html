The <a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> alum <a href=#><strong>Caroline Manzo</strong></a> has become the matriarch of one of Bravo’s most memorable families.</p><p>The reality star was born in August 1961 to parents <strong>Nettie</strong> and <a href=#>Joseph Laurita</a> and is one of the couple’s 11 children — the youngest of which is Caroline’s former costar, <a href=#><strong>Dina Manzo</strong></a>. The sisters were two of <a href=#>RHONJ’s original Housewives</a> upon the show’s premiere in 2009, along with their sister-in-law, <a href=#><strong>Jacqueline Laurita</strong></a>, who married their brother, <strong>Chris Laurita</strong>, in 2002. The show’s season 1 cast also included <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Danielle Staub</strong></a>.</p><p>Caroline’s husband, <strong>Albert Manzo III</strong> — whom she wed in 1984 — was also a ficture on the series, as well as their three children. The pair welcomed their eldest, son, Albie, in 1986, followed by daughter <a href=#>Lauren</a> in 1988. One year later, their youngest, Christopher, was born in 1989.</p><p>Caroline <a href=#>announced her departure</a> from the Bravo series after five seasons in September 2013. “It’s been wonderful, guys,” she wrote via <a href=#>Twitter</a> at the time. “I’ve decided to leave #RHONJ. This season was my last. Love and kisses to you all. xoxoxo.”</p><p>However, she and her family were back on Bravo one year later with the debut of their RHONJ spinoff series, <a href=#>Manzo’d with Children</a>. The show followed Caroline, Albert and their kids and the daily ups and downs of living under the same roof.</p><p>Months after the show’s season 3 finale, Caroline confirmed in February 2017 that the show would <a href=#>not return for a fourth installment</a>. “After three Seasons of Manzo’d we out – Markie drops 🎤,” she captioned a pic of her then-newborn granddaughter, <a href=#>Markie</a> — whom Lauren shares with husband <strong>Vito Scalia</strong> — holding up three fingers via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “We are forever grateful to our viewers, we love you all! ❤.”</p><p>Christopher, for his part, responded to the cancellation news with a post of his own. “Huge thank you to all who’ve watched over the years, and of course Bravo for giving us a platform that changed our lives. We out,” he tweeted at the time.</p><p>In the years since the show’s end, Caroline has continued to share her love for her family via <a href=#>social media</a>. She celebrated Markie’s 6th birthday in February 2023 by sharing a slideshow of their sweetest photos and videos. “I can’t believe she’s six. Our sweet little Marchesa fills our lives with love, laughter, hugs, and sass,” Caroline gushed in the <a href=#>Instagram</a> post’s caption. “May God bless you always, DeeDee, and PopPop love you endlessly—happy birthday to our sweet Markie girl. ❤️❤️❤️❤️.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that year, Albie <a href=#>popped the question</a> to his girlfriend, <strong>Chelsea DeMonaco</strong>. “She said YES!!!! Congratulations to @albiemanzo and @chelseademonaco on their engagement!” Caroline captioned a pic of the happy couple via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “We love you both to bits and are excited for this new chapter in all of our lives. Wedding bells will be ringing!!!! 💍❤️❤️.”</p><p>Scroll below to see more of the Manzo family’s biggest moments over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNksKK%2BzqWgp51doq6vxs6sZJ%2BZnZ65unnToamorZederW0xGawnpmiqHqxtM6tpqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
