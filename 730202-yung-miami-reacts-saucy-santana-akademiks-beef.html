Following Santana’s <a href=# rel>heated response to Ak</a>, Yung Miami chimed in on her Instagram Story. Sharing a photo of Santana’s arm with his finger pointing, Miami wrote, “And when I send you this, it means meet me in the streets p*ssa*ss h0.” The photo was accompanied by a snippet of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a>’s scathing verse on <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rick Ross</a>’ “Stay Schemin” alongside <a href=# class=text-word rel>French Montana</a>.</p><p>This came after Saucy Santana and Akademiks <a href=# rel>issued shots at one another</a>. After Saucy leaped to Miami’s defense, he and Akademiks got into an epithet-fueled shot at one another. However, Santana took it a step further in his latest video where he threatened to sexually assault Akademiks after beating him up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>DJ Akademiks & Saucy Santana Get Into Heated Back And Forth</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saucy-santana-leaps-to-yung-miami-s-defense>Saucy Santana Leaps To Yung Miami’s Defense</h2></span><p>It all began when Akademiks went in on the first week sales for City Girls’ new album, RAW, which moved <a href=# rel>about 10K in its first week</a>. It’s an underwhelming figure, although there was little promotion or announcement before its release. “I talked to almost the head of the RIAA […] they told me this shit went 15x plastic,” Ak said on his stream after the album debuted at #117 on the Billboard 200. “They said, ‘Ak, this is the first triple plastic certification we’ve given out.’ He said the last time they dropped a record, it went double styrofoam, but now we gotta go to plastic.”</p><p>At first, Miami slyly quoted <a href=# class=text-word rel>Meek Mill</a> on X (formerly Twitter) when she responded to Akademiks’ comments. “IF YOU AIN’T ABOUT THAT MURDER GAME THEN PUSSY N***A SHUT UP PLEASEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!” Miami wrote. However, Santana came in afterward and berated Akademiks for frequently trying to have issues with women. He even brought up Akademiks’ recent spat with <a href=# class=text-word rel>GloRilla</a> over the weekend. Finally, Santana invited Akademiks to Yung Miami’s Halloween party to have a face-to-face conversation. Check out Miami’s response to DJ Akademiks and Saucy Santana above.
