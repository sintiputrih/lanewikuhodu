Tributes and condolences flooded social media in the wake of the news. Fans were outraged when Warner Bros Discovery initially did not permit Mark Briscoe to participate in AEW television events, but the situation was resolved quickly. That being said, Mark Briscoe also had a message for his departed brother recently.</p><p>The ROH Hall of Famer was tragically involved in a fatal car accident last week. The Delaware State Police confirmed that another driver crossed the center line and collided with his vehicle head-on.&nbsp;<a href=#>The police are currently investigating the incident</a>.</p><p>As previously reported, a&nbsp;<a href=#>donation page</a>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<a href=#>set up by Briscoe’s family friend for fans to offer their help for the Pugh family</a>. In fact, it ended up smashing its original&nbsp;<a href=#>goal of $50K, getting close to $300k</a>.</p><p>Caprice Coleman, a seasoned ROH commentator who called Mark’s match on Dynamite alongside Ian Riccaboni and Excalibur, posted a video on social media showing Mark and his wife at the airport on Thursday morning.</p><p>“Y’all already know, family is beyond, been beyond important to me in my life. 23 years, me and my brother have been riding the roads, making towns, hitting different countries. Ain’t no way I’ve been wanting to do this for this long if ain’t have my boy with me this whole time. Now, it’s time to carry on for him. Family is beyond. This life is temporary. Let’s focus on the eternal, not the temporal. My brother ain’t with me as he normally has been and normally would be. He’s still with me right here [points to his heart]. He ain’t gone. If I thought he was gone, I wouldn’t be no good. I know he ain’t gone. I know he just moved on to the next higher level of existence. That’s what keeps me going and keeps me pushing forward</p><p>The Jay Briscoe Tribute show turned out to be one of the most emotional episodes of the show since Brodie Lee’s back in December 2020.
