The second one, I felt like I wanted to be married so badly because all my friends were at that place and that’s where I should have been.”</p><p>Kardashian was previously married to<a href=#> &nbsp;<strong>Damon Thomas</strong> from 2000 to 2004, to<strong> Kris Humphries</strong> for 72 days (</a>legally from 2011 to 2013) and to <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> from 2014 to 2021. The SKKN creator and the rapper, 44, who share four kids — North, 9, Saint, 6, Chicago, 4, and Psalm, 3 — finalized their divorce earlier this year.</p><p>“I have this fantasy in my head, like, ‘Fourth time’s a charm — it’s gonna work out,’” she added of walking down the aisle again.</p><p>After Kardashian joked that she “clearly” hasn’t found a man like her late father, <a href=#>Robert</a>, Paltrow, 50, asked, “Are the guys that you’ve been attracted to — would you say fundamentally different [than your dad]?”</p><p>“Yes,” Kardashian responded. “You always look at your dad as the most unique, the most special, the smartest person. There’s definitely qualities for sure of that I’ve seen from people or what I wanted from people in the past. But that should be the standard.”</p><p>While the Hulu star said she’s happily single and wants to stay that way for “a few years,” Kardashian responded “kind of” when the actress asked whether she has a “flirt going on the side” via text.</p><p>“I do,” Kardashian replied as Paltrow joked, “That will get you through a cold winter.”</p><p><a href=#>This is the second candid podcast from Kardashian released this week.</a> The Skims founder got emotional during an interview while speaking about how “f—king hard” it is to coparent with West — who has come under fire for <a href=#>antisemitic comments</a> in recent months — on the “Angie Martinez IRL” podcast, which dropped on Monday, December 26.</p><p>“You ask me about the grace. One day, my kids will thank me for not sitting here and bashing their dad when I could. Of course all the crazy s–t … it kills me for my family,” Kardashian said. “If they don’t know things that are being said, why would I ever bring that energy to them? That is real, heavy, grownup s—t that they are not ready to deal with. When they are, we will have those conversations. One day my kids will thank me for not sitting here and bashing their dad. I could.”</p><p>She also reflected on her post-divorce romance with <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, which ended over the summer after nearly one year of dating, and how West could affect her future relationships.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It was just so new. I didn’t know what dating was for so long. I’d been in a relationship for almost 15 years, 12 years, something like that. I don’t know, there’s a part of me that’s like, ‘Oh, my God, is everyone going to be scared because I don’t have the easiest ex?’” Kardashian said. “I don’t think that’s fair to ever put someone in a situation. … But then there’s a side of me that’s like, ‘Wait, what? Why would I ever have to live that way?’”</p><p>Scroll through for more from Kardashian’s conversation with Paltrow:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKq5jKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mpqdlnZa%2Fs8XIp55mnp%2BnerW0xGZrraBdqbausYyop56mXam8brnOq5xmo5mZwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
