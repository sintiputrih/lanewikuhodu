An affiliate of Rondo's, Lul Tim, shot and killed the Chicago rapper's friend <a href=# class=text-word rel>King Von</a>, an event that would go on to shape Durk's rivalries. During a conversation with DJ Akademiks on the Off The Record, he spoke on the shooting "that changed everybodyâ€™s lives irreparably," and sent shots at the aforementioned peers. "Yeah, that s**t f***ed everybody up, boy, when a real gangsta get took out <a href=# rel>by a nerd type</a>," he said of Tim, adding that Quando is a "little boy."</p><p>However, Quando Rondo caught wind of this, and came through on Twitter with his response to Lil Durk's most recent shots. "The Nerds Got 7 Of 'Em Last Year Urkkkk...." the Savannah, Georgia artist posted on the social media platform. Furthermore, discussion around that statement split into people commenting on the feud and lamenting that these battles resulted in lost lives and pained families. Neither side is exempt from those issues, and many believe that airing these things out for social media clout is disrespectful. "This 'war' a whole clown show. Ppl died for these goofy tweets and weak bars," one fan expressed.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Quando Rondo Wishes He Kept His Personal Life Private</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-quando-rondo-s-response-to-lil-durk>Quando Rondo's Response To Lil Durk</h2></span><p>Still, these circumstances take nuanced understanding to examine, as everyone goes through grief, regret, and the thought that things could be different. It's something that Quando Rondo himself clearly feels, as he recently dropped a <a href=# rel>tribute track</a> to his fallen friend Lul Pab. Many times, these issues stem from much more systemic hardships in "the game," and it can be very difficult for its players to escape that lifestyle. With that being said, this probably and unfortunately won't be the last time we're reminded of the cyclical nature of these beefs.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Voice recently opened up about his <a href=# rel>grief process</a>, whether for King Von or for others in his life or surroundings. In addition, his beef with Quando associate NBA YoungBoy is <a href=# rel>unlikely to slow down anytime soon</a>, either. All fans can hope for is that these battles stay more in the musical side of things and not spill over into people's lives. Regardless, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates on Quando Rondo and Lil Durk.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Lil Durk Net Worth 2023: What Is The Rapper Worth?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbYB1fZBmqK6Znpm8br7Op5uoZaKawLG7zaycZqSZoXqlwdGkZJ2ho6h6rcHLZquipQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
