Our Destiny 2 Beyond Light No Time to Explain guide details precisely how players will be able to get their hands on this extremely rare weapon.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of any new expansion pack is the toy chest full of new goodies to play with. Beyond Light has already signaled Destiny’s intentions with its <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap & Season of the Hunt</a> content on the way.</p><p>An interesting piece of content being added to the Destiny 2 armory is the No Time to Explain pulse rifle. It’s based on a popular weapon from the original Destiny game and it’s quite an exclusive gun to own.</p><p>Find out how to obtain it with our Destiny 2 Beyond Light No Time to Explain guide.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Destiny-2-Beyond-Light_-No-Time-to-Explain-exotic-weapon-guide-no-time-to-explain.jpg><span class="block m-1 ml-0">But we will explain how you can get your hands on it.</span><h2>Beyond Light</h2><p>The year 4 expansion for Destiny takes players to the icy tundra of Europa. Its inclusion will be greeted with the removal of less popular locations and items in the game. As well as the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Stone Crypt Raid</a>, player’s power levels can be increased further, and Season of the Hunt content will also be added too.</p><h2>No Time to Explain pulse rifle</h2><p>Based on the “The Stranger’s Rifle” from the original Destiny, the weapon itself is a solid pulse rifle with a slower rate of fire. The gun has some major perks that make it extremely desirable.</p><ul><li>The weapon refunds precision shots back to the player</li><li>It creates a temporal orb that hovers around your vicinity</li></ul><h2>How to obtain it</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Destiny-2-Beyond-Light_-No-Time-to-Explain-exotic-weapon-guide-digital-edition.jpg><span class="block m-1 ml-0">You’ll need to throw yourself, and your money, to get your hands on it.</span><p>This nostalgic treasure seems to be locked behind a couple of different special editions of the Beyond Light expansion.</p><p>Players will have to purchase either the <strong>Destiny 2 Beyond Light Digital Deluxe Edition ($69.99)&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Stand Edition + Season Pass ($49.99)</strong>. Obviously, due to the weapon’s historic nature, Bungie wants this gun to feel special and limited in that regard.</p><p>There’s no indication as to whether or not the gun will receive a more inclusive window of attainability further down the road.</p><p>With these editions in hand, you’ll need to play through the whole campaign and take out Eramus. Then, talk to the Exo Stranger to get the weapon and a new mission titled Soon. Finish that mission and you’ll get the No Time To Explain exotic catalyst. The catalyst has the Full Auto Trigger System trait, so holding down the fire trigger will shoot it at full auto.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.dexerto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NoTime.jpg><span class="block m-1 ml-0">This fantastic new exotic will turn you into a rifle-toting space wizard.</span><p>In addition to this, No Time to Explain also has more amazing features.</p><p><strong>Rewind Again</strong></p><ul><li>With these intrinsic traits, players’ precision shots and shots that are slowed or frozen by Stasis are returned to the magazine</li><li>There’s also an ultra-light Fluted Barrel and Accurized Rounds for greater shot distance.</li><li>Time Slip opens a portal after 10 stacks of Rewind Again, shooting bullets from an alternate timeline of the ongoing events in-game.</li></ul><h2>Weapons and gear trailer</h2><p>The weapon was first made public in the Destiny 2: Beyond Light – Weapons and gear trailer.</p><p>To see the weapon, and others, in action then check out the video below.</p><p><strong>Timestamp at 0:15</strong>.<br></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bungie</a>‘s Destiny 2 Beyond Light is now available for players to sink their teeth into.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbHXnqmtp16YvK57w56qraGernylsdKtoKexXWd6o7HYqKWdZZyetKnAjKemZqyZorJuwM5mnLGonJa2r3nEsaatoZNixKatz6ilZp%2BlnrGmeZBtbGlqZ2t8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
