Jules is a banker and party girl who falls on hard times when she loses her job and her excessive spending catches up to her.</p><p>Despite receiving negative reviews at the time, St. Elmo’s Fire was a box office success, becoming a cult classic and one of the forerunners to the famed Brat Pack. The group of 1980s actors featured St. Elmo’s Fire stars Moore, <strong>Andrew McCarthy</strong>, <strong>Emilio Esteves</strong>, <strong>Rob Lowe</strong>, <strong>Judd Nelson</strong> and <strong>Ally Sheedy</strong>, as well as <strong>Molly Ringwald</strong> and <strong>Anthony Michael Hall</strong>.</p><p><a href=#>The group reunited</a> for a McCarthy-directed Hulu documentary, Brats, which released on June 13. Moore reflected on the chance to revisit the Brat Pack’s height.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Demi-Moore-Celebrates-39th-St-Elmo-s-Fire-with-365-Edit-from-Charli-XCX-1.jpg><p>“I had such a great time sitting down and talking with [McCarthy.] I’m sad there wasn’t an opportunity where we were all sitting in a room together, talking,” she said in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>. “That’s my only wish. It’s something very unique to all of us that we experienced.”</p><p>She added that the group didn’t always like being referred to as the Brat Pack.</p><p>None of us really liked the idea of being called ‘brats,’ or that we weren’t professionals or didn’t take our work seriously,” she said. “It was such an interesting, curious thing. We all had different experiences. [The Brat Pack] was very impactful for Andrew, and shifted the direction of his career.”</p><p>Moore’s decision to use “365” in her commemorative post is fitting. It’s the final track on Charli XCX’s album, Brat, which she released on June 7. That led her fanbase to dub summer 2024 “Brat Girl Summer.”</p><p>Charli described what Brat Girl Summer means to her in an appearance on the “<a href=# rel=noopener>BBC Sounds Sidetracked</a>” podcast.</p><p>“It can be, like, so trashy — like a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter and a strappy white top with no bra,” she said. “That’s like, kind of all you need.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Slate’s review</a> of Brat took it a little further, describing the overall aesthetic of what would become Brat Girl Summer.</p><p>“The themes colliding this summer — our f—it indulgences, the feeling of being over, a crushing sense of nihilism that has no cure other than, perhaps, dancing in a smoke-filled basement — are perfectly encapsulated by Charli XCX’s new album Brat,” Slate’s <strong>Scaachi Koul</strong> wrote.</p><p>Exactly the type of summer that would make Jules Van Patten proud.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuepZliurC70Z5knJ2cmq%2BzrdOeqmarpGKyrbnOrGSfoaKaeqK6zaKtnqqjlr%2B6edaiq6Flk52us7jIZq%2BcsF2ovK%2Bzjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
