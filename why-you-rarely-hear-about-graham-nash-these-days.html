Music would, it seems, be a huge part of his life from the off. More specifically, musical collaborations. According to the outlet, the young schoolboy Nash found a musical partner in Allan Clarke. By their teenage years, they were performing as Ricky and Dane Young. Further collaborations saw their numbers swell until Nash was an up-and-comer in a group that would become known as <a href=#>the Hollies</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>From there, tremendous success awaited. Per <a href=#>Britannica</a>, the 1968 creation of <a href=#>Crosby, Stills & Nash</a> brought together three of the biggest musical names of their era (David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Nash himself), and were, for a time, also joined by Neil Young as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. It was a lineup for the ages, and their releases were legendary. 1970's "Déjà Vu" was deemed by <a href=#>AllMusic's</a>&nbsp;Bruce Eder to have been "One of the most hotly awaited second albums in history," a chart-topping "product of four potent musical talents who were all ascending to the top of their game."</p><p dir=ltr>As a solo performer, per <a href=#>Nash's official website</a>, he found great success too. Beginning in earnest in 1971, he released several solo albums, and 1977 would see Crosby, Stills & Nash launch a reunion album. 2012 marked the band's most recent release, a compilation of some of their iconic live performances. Of late, however, Nash's more low-profile commitments and his personal struggles have seen him become rather quiet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHBpcG5iZMSpxYyypq5lopa%2FprjYZp%2BemaJirqO71K1koKqRna6uec2aqqFlpJ2ytLGMnZiyq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
