He added that the children had come across the spider while herding goats in Chayanta province and thought it looked like the spider featured in the Marvel movie.</p>An informative TechInsider video on the effects of a black widow spider bite.<p>Fortunately, the boys’ mother found them crying just in time to rush them to a local health center. Aware of the time-sensitive dangers at hand, professionals immediately transferred the children to a nearby hospital to be properly treated.</p><p>Things took a terrifying turn when all three siblings experienced muscle pains, fevers, and tremors. At last, a final transfer to the Children’s Hospital in La Paz brought them back to health.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Telemundo</a>, they were discharged on Wednesday, May 20 — nearly a week after being bitten the previous Thursday.</p><p>A black widow’s bite is certainly not a death sentence, and the three young boys have recovered well. However, black widow bites can be fatal to at-risk groups, and children “are among those most at risk, along with the elderly and infirm,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained National Geographic</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-281408 alt="Spiderman Fan At La Paz Childrens Hospital" width=900 height=598 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/spiderman-fan-at-la-paz-childrens-hospital.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-281408 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Facebook</span><span class=caption-body>Oddly enough, this picture was taken at La Paz Children’s Hospital just last year, showing just how beloved and influential these modern superhero myths can be.</span></p><p>Black widows are the most venomous spiders in North America. According to National Geographic, their venom is 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake’s. Naturally, they’re one of the most feared species of spider on the planet.</p><p>Though black widows aren’t naturally aggressive, they certainly respond as such in self-defense. It is no wonder that when the Chayanta boys poked the spider, it felt threatened and acted out.</p><p>Perhaps Pietro best surmised the incident when he concluded that, “For children everything is real, movies are real, dreams can be real, and they are the illusions of our lives.”</p><p>Next up, read about <a href=#>the tech billionaire who wants to inject himself with young people’s blood to stay young himself</a>.
