The <a href=# rel=follow>ban was not lifted</a>, just so you know.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>That was the last anyone had heard from Ninja on the matter until he said in a now-deleted tweet that "All will be explained," hinting that the supposed feud between arguably the two biggest streamers on Twitch would be sorted out.&nbsp;</p><p>But then, <a href=# rel=follow>nothing came of Ninja's premonition</a>. A day later, Pokimane clapped back, saying,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I thought it was kind of interesting that Ninja was like, 'Everything will be clarified.' And then he woke up the next day and played Fortnite for 7 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>From her vantage point, she believed that Ninja and JiDion shared much of the same viewership, and flipping sides at this point would mean that Ninja would lose viewers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ninja Lied to JiDion's Fans</h2><p>In response to Pokimane calling out Ninja, she got a <a href=# rel=follow>DM from his wife</a>, Jessica. Jessica&nbsp;explicitly stated that Ninja had lied to get out of a tricky situation.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ninja had clearly said that he had sent a text to his representative at Twitch to pull on some strings to get JiDion back on board.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Turns out, Ninja never sent that text and simply lied to stop the harassment he'd been receiving from JiDion's fans.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Pokimane leaked Jessica Blevin's DM </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>Moreover, Jessica claimed that Pokimane was well aware of what had happened and was garnering hate and defaming her husband's good name.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jessica accused Pokimane of "actively bringing harassment" to Ninja and herself "at the highest level.&nbsp;</p><p>To top it all off, Jessica said that Team Ninja was considering everything an act of defamation of character and very seriously so. She added that a lawsuit was on the table and&nbsp;the legal team would be involved in the matter.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKifoLaurc2eZKehnp%2BubrjAsKquoaRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
