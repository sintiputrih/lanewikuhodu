He’s been in the rap game for over two decades, and his music has influenced and inspired a generation of rappers. One of his most famous songs is “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” from his 2001 album, “The Blueprint.” The song is catchy, fun, and filled with witty rhymes, but what does it all mean?</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="The Meaning Behind The Song: Izzo (H.O.V.A.) by Jay-Z">The Meaning Behind The Song: Izzo (H.O.V.A.) by Jay-Z</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="The Hook">The Hook</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title=H.O.V.A.>H.O.V.A.</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title=VA>VA</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="The Anthem">The Anthem</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="The Verses">The Verses</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title="The Legacy">The Legacy</a></li><li class="ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2"><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8" href=# title=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Hook></span>The Hook<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first thing that stands out about “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” is its hook, which is based on a sample from “I Want You Back” by The Jackson 5. The sample is chopped up and rearranged to create a catchy, upbeat melody that’s impossible not to dance to.</p><p>But what about the lyrics? The hook goes:</p><p>“H to the Izzo, V to the Izzay<br>For shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<br>H to the Izzo, V to the Izzay<br>That’s the anthem, get your damn hands up”</p><p>At first glance, these lyrics may seem like they don’t mean much, but there’s actually quite a bit going on here.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=HOVA></span>H.O.V.A.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The first line of the hook is the most obvious place to start. “H to the Izzo, V to the Izzay” is Jay-Z’s way of spelling out his nickname, Hova, which is short for “Jehovah,” a name for God in the Judeo-Christian tradition. The nickname is fitting, as Jay-Z has long been considered one of the greatest rappers of all time, and his influence on the rap game can be compared to that of a higher power.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=VA></span>VA<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The second line of the hook mentions VA, which stands for Virginia. This is a reference to Jay-Z’s past as a drug dealer. Before he made it big in the rap game, Jay-Z was involved in selling drugs in his hometown of Brooklyn, New York. He would often travel to Virginia to buy drugs and bring them back to New York to sell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Anthem></span>The Anthem<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The final two lines of the hook are arguably the most important. “H to the Izzo, V to the Izzay / That’s the anthem, get your damn hands up” is Jay-Z’s way of declaring the song as an anthem for his fans to rally behind. He’s calling on his fans to show their support by raising their hands and getting into the spirit of the song.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Verses></span>The Verses<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the hook of “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” is catchy and memorable, the verses are where Jay-Z really shines. Here are some of the standout lines from the song:</p><p>– “Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off” – This line is a clever play on the phrase “brush it off,” which means to dismiss something or move on from it. Jay-Z is telling his female fans to be confident and assertive, just like male pimps are.<br>– “I’m not a businessman, I’m a business, man” – This line has become one of Jay-Z’s most famous quotes. It’s a testament to his entrepreneurial spirit and his ability to turn his rap career into a successful business empire.<br>– “I do this for my culture, to let ’em know what a n***a look like when a n***a in a roadster” – This line is a reference to the stereotype of black men as criminals or gangsters. Jay-Z is using his success and wealth to challenge that stereotype and show that black men can achieve great things.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Legacy></span>The Legacy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” may have been released in 2001, but its impact can still be felt today. The song has become a staple at sports events, parties, and clubs, and its catchy hook and memorable verses have made it one of Jay-Z’s most beloved songs.</p><p>But beyond its catchy melody and clever rhymes, “Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” is a testament to Jay-Z’s talent and his ability to create music that resonates with fans. The song is a celebration of his success, but it’s also a call to action for his fans to join him in that celebration. In many ways, it’s a fitting anthem for Jay-Z’s entire career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“Izzo (H.O.V.A.)” is more than just a fun, catchy song. It’s a declaration of Jay-Z’s greatness and a call to action for his fans to join him in celebrating that greatness. The song’s legacy has endured for over two decades, and it’s a testament to the lasting impact that Jay-Z has had on the rap game and on popular culture as a whole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG612bOmZqBdpHq3ecBmmbJlmpbGbsaO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
