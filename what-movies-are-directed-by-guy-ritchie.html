He then went on to helm the less well-received and critically acclaimed Revolver (2005) and RocknRolla (2008).</p><p>He was the director of the financially successful films Sherlock Holmes and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, released in 2009 and 2011, respectively. Best Original Score and Best Art Direction Academy Award nominations were made for the former.</p><p>His previous films include the live-action version of Disney’s Aladdin, King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015), which is a recreation of a 1960s spy series (2019).</p><p>During its theatrical run, Aladdin made more than $1 billion worldwide, making it one of the top-grossing movies of 2019 and the 34th-highest-grossing movie of all time. In the generally well-received and financially successful The Gentleman (2019), he returned to crime comedy in 2020.</p><p>He oversaw Jason Statham’s performance in the action movie Wrath of Man in 2021. Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, his twelfth film, which was originally scheduled for 2022, came out in March 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKmt02akqK6ZmsBurdGeZJ2hopqwtbHDZpmyZZeqxm6%2ByK2aoaGVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
