According to a Rolling Stone <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>, plaintiff Julia Holcomb has alleged that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aerosmith</a> front man began a sexual relationship with her when she was 16 years old in 1973. In the lawsuit, she claims Tyler learned of her troubled home life and later convinced her mother to grant him guardianship, which let him “travel with, assault and provide alcohol and drugs” to her while she was a teen. She alleges she “was powerless to resist” Tyler’s “power, fame and substantial financial ability, and that he “coerced and persuaded” her into believing the relationship was “a ‘romantic love affair.’” Holcomb also accuses Tyler of insisting she get an abortion after she got pregnant with his child at age 17. Allegedly, he cited health concerns from a recent apartment fire and threatened to stop supporting her if she did not end the pregnancy.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clca4rj0d00323b6r5jit5zzl@published data-word-count=168>Although the lawsuit does not identify Tyler by name, Holcomb has previously made these claims in <a href=#>anti-abortion rallies</a> and public interviews. The filing also quotes directly from Tyler’s memoir, in which he wrote that he “almost took a teen bride” and that “her parents fell in love with me, signed a paper over for me to have custody, so I wouldn’t get arrested if I took her out of state.” He described her as his “heart’s desire, my partner in crimes of passion,” noting that his “bad self” was 26 at the time. Holcomb alleges she did not consent to being mentioned in the memoir’s acknowledgments, which reference a “Julia Halcomb” — one letter off from her name. News of this lawsuit comes just days before the December 31 deadline for California’s 2019 Child Victims Act, which temporarily lifted the statute of limitations to allow survivors of childhood sexual abuse to come forward with allegations.Representatives for Tyler, now 74, did not immediately respond to Vulture’s request for comment.</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Rolling Stone</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Rolling Stone</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjs0u2y9y00505sy660nsul1d@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Grammys Love a Rap-Rock Performance, But What’s the Best One?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-d2d7a6d19fe8305a06e710500ff3b4ae@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>And Now Deep Thoughts, With Steven Tyler</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Steven Tyler Sued for Allegedly Sexually Assaulting Minor</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgaXy0wMSvnKdlpK65pr6MrKyenF2Wua2xxp6bpbFdqLK5wcClo7JlkajAosHLraCnn12itq%2B70WefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
