Don't watch me breathe. I won't be able to sleep. Go do something else.' It's so funny, because part of me would never want someone to say that to me, but then again, I write it."</p></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>What movie was it used in?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cf-images.eu-west-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/6057949401001/7f864eed-d307-4774-b073-f1c094910994/2c5efa16-6bfe-4f40-946d-f3a682228d49/640x360/match/image.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Armageddon trailer (1998)</p><ul><li>The song was written for the 1998 disaster movie Armageddon starring <a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>U2</a> were apparently in line to record the song, but once Liv Tyler was cast, her father Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith were chosen instead.</li></ul><ul><li>The movie became the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.</li></ul><ul><li>Celine Dion was also considered, with Warren later saying: "I remember being at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, and sitting at the piano with [Tyler] and teaching him the song and just having chills all over my body as I heard the song come to life with his voice and knowing what it was going to be. It was an amazing experience. I'd written with Aerosmith before, and they'd never done the songs we wrote."</li></ul></li><li class=collection__item><h2 class=title>What happens in the music video?</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/JkK8g6FMEXE/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Aerosmith - I Don't Want to Miss a Thing (Official HD Video)</p><ul><li>It was shot at the Minneapolis Armory in 1998, and was directed by Francis Lawrence.

It has also sold over a million copies in the UK, peaking at four.</li></ul><ul readability=1.5><li readability=6>Aerosmith didn't care that their biggest hit was written by somebody else. Joe Perry said: "At the time, we just didn't have the time to settle down and do it. We were out on the road, so they brought us in to see the movie and said 'here's the song, this is where it fits into the movie, you can do it if you want.'<p>So we were in the studio within the next three days cutting it. And yeah, we do wish that we'd had a little more time, so that we could have had a shot at writing it, but it was perfect timing. The song was great, people loved it, and I don't think people care that much who wrote it."</p></li></ul></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLnOqKuhqpGZtrB6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZq2glWLAtbvRsmSonl%2BeeqW7za1ksJmeqXq1u4ymoKyrXZZ6tbTIp55mmZWnvLS5yK2fZqSpp7akv4yvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
