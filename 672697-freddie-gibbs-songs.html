Originally signed to Interscope and then <a href=# rel>Jeezy’s label</a>, he went independent and went on a historic run of classic mixtapes, albums, and collaborations. On top of that, he's also delivered several collaborative projects with Madlib, The <a href=# class=text-word rel>Alchemist</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Curren$y</a>, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Statik Selektah</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a list of the best Freddie Gibbs songs. Because he has consistently released so many quality bodies of work, it is challenging to narrow his music down to just seven songs. Some tracks that did not make the list but were worth mentioning include the soulful “Cataracts” and "High.” Dark bangers like “Pronto” and “<a href=# rel>Fuckin Up The Count</a>” stand out in Freddie’s catalog, as do the vulnerable “Forever and a Day” and the descriptive “White Range.” “20 Karat Jesus” deserves mentioning as it is arguably his best intro song with its heavenly beat switch. The difficulty in making a list of the best Freddie Gibbs songs speaks to the quality, consistency, and longevity of his discography. Take a look at the list below.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-harold-s-2014>7. "Harold's" (2014)</h2></span><p>This song is undoubtedly the best hip-hop song about fast food fried chicken. The song is inspired by the Chicago-based restaurant Harold’s Fried Chicken. The hook is a breakdown of Freddie's usual order (six wings, mild sauce, and all the fries with all the fries you can give me). While the song does pay homage to the midwestern chicken restaurant, Freddie Gibbs keeps his gangster-isms throughout the verses. The beat from Madlib also has a nice groove to it.</p><span></span><p>Bob James’s “Nautilus” is one of hip hop’s most sampled songs, and “Extradite" is arguably one of the best flips of the sample. The beat constantly evolves throughout the course of the song. In addition to the filthy beat, Freddie trades verses with Black Thought, who delivers <a href=# rel>one of his best guest features</a>. Not many rappers can keep up with Black Thought on a track and Freddie’s performance on the song speaks volumes to his lyrical skills.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-shame-2012>5. "Shame" (2012)</h2></span><p>Freddie Gibbs & Madlib’s classic debut collaboration, 2014’s Piñata, perfectly combines Freddie Gibbs’s gangsta rap style with Madlib’s experimental yet vintage production style. The album consists of many tough gangsta rap songs but there are also plenty of smooth highlights, such as the beautifully soulful “Shame." Madlib samples “Wish That You Were Mine” by The Manhattans for the gorgeous production. However, it's the show-stealing chorus from BJ The Chicago that adds to the soul of the song, making for a chill moment of joy on an album full of street raps.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-alexys-2017>4. "Alexys" (2017)</h2></span><p>Jazz band BADBADNOTGOOD and dance producer Kaytranada have close connections to hip hop and have made their fair share of rap collabs. They linked together for “Alexys,” from Freddie Gibbs’s You Only Live 2wice, resulting in one of his best songs. The beat is unlike anything Freddie has ever rapped over, with Kaytranada’s radiant musical textures and the precise percussion from BADBADNOTGOOD. The beat is unique on its own but it is perfect for Freddie Gibbs’s rapping as he paints a vivid picture of his introduction to street life, drawing references from various movies and TV shows. “Alexys” is a highlight from one of Freddie’s most underrated albums and is one of his best songs.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-giannis-2019>3. "Giannis" (2019)</h2></span><p>“Giannis” is a definitive highlight from Freddie Gibbs and Madlib’s second collaboration, 2019’s Bandana. The beat features a smooth loop of “Aasman Ke Neeche” from the 1967 Hindi film Jewel Thief. The drum break over the sample allows Freddie to weave between slow and double-time flows, fueled by clever punchlines. One lyrical moment in the song that makes it so impressive is that Freddie breaks down what a 360 deal is in the music industry and why an artist can fail if they rely too much on their label. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Anderson .Paak</a>’s guest appearance is a showstopper as he handles the song’s well-sung chorus, along with a mean verse.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-thuggin-2011>2. "Thuggin" (2011)</h2></span><p>Rubba’s “Way Star” has been sampled numerous times in hip hop, and Freddie Gibbs and Madlib’s flip on the sample for “Thuggin” is easily the best flip. The hazy sample with its acoustic twang makes for a dream-like backdrop for Freddie to rap about the ruthless nature of the streets. With a cinematic touch, Freddie first-person portrayal as the anti-hero mirrors his reality. He depicts a life of crime, tying it together on the song’s catchy chorus, rapping, “I'm straight thuggin', uh/ And it feels so good, uh, and it feels so right.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-bandana-2019>1. "Bandana" (2019)</h2></span><p>It is perplexing why the 2019 single from Freddie Gibbs and Madlib, titled “Bandana,” did not make the final tracklist of their album Bandana. The song served as a promotional single but because the song is so good, it can stand by itself. The greatness of the song speaks for itself. The instrumental consists of a hauntingly spacey instrumental over a knocking drum pattern. Freddie Gibbs spits his classic style of crime-filled drug raps with his signature deep voice. He floats over the beat and he brilliantly incorporates the last line of each verse to make the song’s refrain.</p><p>Jamaican dancehall deejay Assassin, who has worked with many rappers, is the perfect feature. He asserts his presence with just a repeated uttering of the word “bandana” in the refrain before making the track his own on his verse. “Bandana" stands alone for good reason as there is no song that sounds like it. The song makes a strong argument for its high rank among the best Freddie Gibbs songs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbH93hZZmnaudlJm2pnnGopmbq12ovK%2Bz0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
