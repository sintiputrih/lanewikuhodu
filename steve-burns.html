He attended Boyertown Area Senior High School in Berks County and graduated from there in 1991.</p><p>In 1995, Burns auditioned for Blue’s Clues, thinking it was another voice-over role. He had long hair and an earring. “I was a bit of a skate rat,” he said. Initially, the Nickelodeon executives were not supportive of Burns hosting their new show; in subsequent auditions, the show’s creators requested that he dress more conservatively. (Burns reported that the creators, in a call-back phone conversation, asked him, “Could you not look like yourself tomorrow morning?”) It became apparent, however, that he was the favorite with preschool test audiences. Executive producer and co-creator Traci Paige Johnson reported that of the 100 people they auditioned, Burns was “the realest.” As Dr. Alice Wilder, Nickelodeon’s Director of Research and Development, said: “[T]here was just something about this kid, who was fresh out of Pennsylvania, who just knew where to look in the camera to really talk to kids. He was just right.”</p><p align=justify>There are two sisters named Jennifer Karen and Jennifer.

He became “a superstar” among his audience and their parents, but unknown to everyone else, and enjoyed what he called being a “micro-celebrity, about as small a celebrity as you can be.” As the New York Times reported, he “developed an avid following among both preteen girls and mothers. The former send torrents of e-mail; the latter scrutinize the show with an intensity that might make even Elmo, the red Muppet, blush.” In 2000, People magazine included Burns in their annual list of America’s most eligible bachelors. According to writer Diane Tracy, Burns was “destined for the part.” Also, according to Tracy, Burns was not the typical children’s television host: “There is nothing syrupy about him—his humor is sometimes borderline offbeat, but never inappropriate for preschoolers.”</p><h2>Steve Burns Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Steve Burns is one of the <strong>richest TV Actor</strong> from United States.

He started work on the album after he left Blue’s Clues in 2002, and it was released in 2003. He posted eleven songs on his webpage and then realizing he needed help with drums and arrangements went to Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips for advice.

Burns replied, “The rumor mill surrounding me has always been really strange.” Some of these “specious claims” included: death from a heroin overdose, being killed in a car accident, and, like what was rumored to have happened to Paul McCartney in 1966, him having been replaced with a look-alike. After Burns’ departure, the Blue’s Clues actor was then replaced by Donovan Patton as Steve’s younger brother “Joe”. Burns made an appearance on The Rosie O’Donnell Show to dispute these rumors, and he and co-creator Angela Santomero appeared on The Today Show to help concerned parents extinguish the fears of kids who may have heard these rumors.</p><p align=justify>Burns started a band, Steve Burns and the Struggle, and completed his second album, Deep Sea Recovery Efforts, which was released in 2009.
