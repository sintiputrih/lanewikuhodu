Here’s what you need to know about the next generation of PCIe.</p><h2>Availability</h2><p>PCIe 3 has been available on a huge swathe of different motherboards since 2010, and continues to be the most populous PCIe port available in 2020. It’s found on 300 and 400-series motherboards for AMD’s first and second generation Ryzen CPUs, as well as on Intel 300-series boards used for its 8th and 9th-gen processors. It’s also found on most boards released over a few years before these chip generations.</p><p>PCIe 4 made its debut with <a href=#>AMD’s third-generation Ryzen processors</a> on its 500-series motherboards, specifically with the x570 chipset. As of early 2020, the only motherboards that support PCIe 4 are based on the AMD x570 chipset.</p><p>Intel hasn’t made any official commitment to PCIe 4 support on compatible motherboards, though it has released its own <a href=#>PCIe 4 SSDs</a>. Some rumors pointed to Intel debuting PCIe 4 with its 10th-generation Comet Lake CPUs, but that due to problems implementing it, Intel had to nix the feature, according to <a href=#>Toms Hardware</a>. Meanwhile,<a href=#> our own reporting</a> has revealed internal documents that confirm that Intel’s new Xe graphics cards will use PCIe 4.</p><p>Motherboards may still technically support it, though, so it may be that when the next-next-generation Rocket Lake CPUs debut in 2021, that existing Comet Lake boards could gain the feature with a chip upgrade.</p><p>Other speculation says that Intel may skip PCIe 4 altogether and instead push for the recently standardized PCIe 5 with future CPU generations.</p><h2>Speed</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.digitaltrends.com/data:image/gif;base64><p>The greatest advantage of PCIe 4 over PCIe 3 is in its speed — or overall bandwidth. Like generations of PCIe before it, PCIe 4 doubles its bandwidth over the last-generation, increasing the per-lane bandwidth to 2 gigabytes per second (2GBps). With options for 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, and 16x slots, that increases the maximum potential bandwidth for a PCIe 4 slot to 64GBps.</p><p>This gives anything that plugs into a PCIe slot more headroom, but for the most powerful of graphics cards, that’s not really needed just yet. The 2080 Ti, the most powerful mainstream <a href=# data-injected=1>graphics card</a> ever made, doesn’t come close to saturating an x16 PCIe 3 slot, only seeing some bottlenecking on PCIe 3 x8 slots, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TechPowerUp proved in its 2018 testing</a>.</p><p>Where this additional bandwidth can be taken advantage of in full is with other kinds of add-in cards. Most namely, storage. Multiple PCIexpress 4.0 NVMe drives can operate in RAID 0 configuration to offer sequential read/write speeds of up to 15GBps.</p><h2>Extra lanes and compatibility</h2><p>With little real-world tasks that can take advantage of the full bandwidth of PCIe 4 x16 slots, the major advantage of it, at least in the near future, will be in the reduction in lane requirements for devices and add-in cards. Instead of a 10 Gigabit network card requiring multiple PCIe 3 lanes, it can get away with just a 1x slot. Graphics cards can operate at PCIe 4 x8 speeds, enjoying the same bandwidth as PCIe 3 x16 slots, but with half the lanes used.</p><p>Those additional lanes can be freed up for additional devices in larger builds, or allow for faster devices to operate on smaller PCIe slots for more compact systems.</p><p>Supporting boards aren’t limited to PCIe 4 devices either. PCIe 4 slots are entirely backwards compatible, meaning that any older-generation PCIe devices, whether it’s first, second, or third generation, will work just fine with PCIe 4.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfmLyuvNStoKefX6WwqrGMbWSvq12lsKqxjGxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
