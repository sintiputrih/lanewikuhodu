And surprisingly, the cast also included Stormy’s own daughter, Maniya Essence Canty, all set up to follow in her mother’s footsteps and add another million to her net worth.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep reading this Maniya Essence Canty Bio to learn all about her.</span></p><h3><b>Maniya Essence Canty On Million Dollar Hustle</b></h3><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Million Dollar Hustle</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 1 premiered on Mar 17, 2022, and there appeared Stormy Wellington with her “Circle of Bosses” including Maniya who faced off each other to be in Stormy’s inner elite circle.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Maniya this season were her co-stars — Dianna Williams, Nathalie Nicole Smith, Ana Cantera, Bawselady, Tammy Price, and Bianca Shadai.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But meanwhile, every participant competed to be close to Stormy; Maniya, who already is the self-made millionaire’s daughter, was featured more from the personal life story of Stormy. For instance, the mother-daughter was captured having a fallout after Maniya unknowingly had dinner with a woman that her mother did not like.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Later, though an IG live, Maniya even revealed that her mother kicked her out of the house for that reason. “You don’t do that to your child,” she shared in the IG live. Also, though she acknowledged the fact that her mother loved her, she wasn’t happy about Stormy’s “weird way of showing it.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But that’s all in the past now, Maniya and Stormy have since mended their relationship. In an IG post (dated Feb 28, 2022), Maniya shared a picture alongside her mother, captioned, “You only get one mom, cherish her. – Note to self.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Likewise, Stormy made an IG post herself accusing those around her of trying to come between them. “She knows my heartbeat from the inside @maniya_ you sickos really tried to separate us.. this is how I learned spiritual attacks!!! You won’t win though my God is in control,” she wrote.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wondering how much of the show is real? Well, as for as well know the show’s totally legit.
