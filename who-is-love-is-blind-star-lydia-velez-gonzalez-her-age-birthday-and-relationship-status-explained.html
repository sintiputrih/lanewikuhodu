With only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two couples making it to the altar</a> and just 10 episodes to watch, viewers have expressed feeling short-changed. Despite the excessive amount of filler, season 5 still had its fair share of drama, most of which revolved around Lydia Velez Gonzalez.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Here’s your final warning; If you’re still catching up on episodes from season 5 of&nbsp;Love is Blind,&nbsp;you may want to stop reading. We’re diving right into who Lydia is, her impact on the show, and her relationship status.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-lydia-velez-gonzalez data-injectable=false>Who is Lydia Velez Gonzalez?</h2><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Lydia Velez Gonzalez is a Houston-based geologist from Puerto Rico.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bustle</a>, her now-deleted LinkedIn shared that she received an undergraduate degree in geology from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and a Master’s degree in environmental management from the University of Maryland Global Campus.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=242 data-injectable=false>In the first episode of&nbsp;Love is Blind,&nbsp;she describes herself as “a big personality, and I love hard. I love to laugh, I love to make jokes, I love to dance, I am loud. I’m from Puerto Rico, so it comes with the territory.”</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=true>Lydia made history on the show when she recognized her ex’s voice in the pods, a first for the reality show. Producers claimed they had no idea she and cast member Uche Okoroha had dated in the past, making for an awkward reveal later in the season.</p><h2 id=h-who-did-lydia-connect-with-in-the-pods data-injectable=false>Who did Lydia connect with in the pods?</h2><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>Initially, Lydia connected to engineer Milton Johnson and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">insurance representative Izzy Zapata</a>. However, when Izzy began having stronger connections with two other women, he cut things off with Lydia in an emotional yet awkward conversation. It worked out for the best, though, as she could then focus all her attention on Milton, who was a far better match for her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Is Blind (@loveisblindnetflix)</a></p></figure><h2 id=h-how-old-is-lydia data-injectable=false>How old is Lydia?</h2><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Lydia is currently 32, which she announced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a> on Aug. 29. The geologist shared she was 30 during the show’s filming, which shows how much time has passed since all of the couples first met. Her age was a point of contention on the show as Milton was just 24 at the time, which she initially felt was too young for her.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-did-lydia-get-married data-injectable=false>Did Lydia get married?</h2><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Of the few couples who got engaged on season 5 of&nbsp;Love is Blind, Milton and Lydia appeared the most stable. Despite their age difference and some concern from his family, they made it to the altar, and both said, “I do!” But that was over a year ago, so the big question is, are they still together?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Love Is Blind (@loveisblindnetflix)</a></p></figure><h2 id=h-are-milton-and-lydia-still-together data-injectable=false>Are Milton and Lydia still together?</h2><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>While there’s no proven evidence that Lydia and Milton split up, I can’t help but notice that they don’t follow each other on Instagram. Also, Milton has zero pictures of Lydia on his page, even screenshots from the show.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>Possibly even worse is that the only photo Lydia has of Milton on her page is a screenshot from their dinner with her mother and brother for the show. Her caption is a long dedication to her mom, and everyone seems to be tagged in it except Milton. Of course, this could all be part of their to avoid spoilers, but I’m getting serious divorce vibes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=160 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=false>I guess we’ll just have to wait and find out if they’re still together <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on the reunion episode</a>, which starts streaming on Netflix tonight at 8 pm ET!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnKTDpnnIrGSbpJmjsW6%2F05qpZqSpmbaiedWeo56yXZy8r8bApZyzZZiav26txp5km6GiqbWlrdhmmKecXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW6%2F05qrrqtdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
