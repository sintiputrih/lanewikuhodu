While entertaining, his "over the top" videos have often landed the internet star in trouble, including his <a href=#>hate raid of Pokimane's, resulting in a Twitch permaban</a>. More recently, however, the YouTube prankster reported getting into trouble with the French police.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In a Tweet, JiDion claimed he‚Äôd been arrested in Paris and jailed for a night. The reason behind the arrest is still unknown. However, fans online suspect it may have been because one of his <a href=#>YouTube</a> stunts went wrong, with some speculating that an arrest was "bound to happen." Still, it doesn't appear JiDion is fazed, stating that a ‚Äúbanger" video explaining what transpired will be released soon.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>YouTuber JiDion Allegedly Arrested And Jailed In Paris</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/6SCxE-yDbtj_srx4gL7riYcNIRntwMeX-YCDj0hNSgU/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9KaURpb24vWW91VHViZV9QcmFua3N0ZXJfSmlEaW9uX0FycmVzdGVkX0FuZF9KYWlsZWRfSW5fUGFyaXNfWW91VHViZS5qcGc><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to JiDion's vague Twitter post on 11th August 2022, the YouTuber claimed he‚Äôd been arrested in France and spent the night in a Paris prison cell. In a follow-up Tweet, JiDion told his fans that they should anticipate a ‚Äúbanger soon,‚Äù presumably another one of his funny videos debuting on YouTube shortly.</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Just spent the night in a Paris jail so banger soonüôÇüá´üá∑</p>‚Äî WiDion (@Jidion6) <a href=#>August 11, 2022</a><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As of writing, JiDion hasn‚Äôt addressed the reason behind his arrest. But he did post another Tweet stating he ventured into the catacombs of Paris and spent the night sleeping in them. He also informed fans of his excitement, saying, ‚Äúliterally can‚Äôt wait for y‚Äôall to see this.‚Äù</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Spent the night in the Catocombs (Not way I got arrested lol) literally can‚Äôt wait for y‚Äôall to see thisüòÖ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cRCgOQzM6t</a></p>‚Äî WiDion (@Jidion6) <a href=#>August 11, 2022</a><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To date, JiDion has over five million subscribers on YouTube, boasting an insane four hundred million views. So, it's safe to say he is one of the most prominent YouTubers on the platform, with his antics and content theme directed toward pranking people or establishments and making people laugh.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, the YouTube star attracted major attention after one of his uproaring controversies went viral; this was when <a href=#>JiDion Twitch raided Imane ‚ÄúPokimane‚Äù</a> Anys and got his users to spam toxic insults during Pokimane‚Äôs live stream. This harassment later resulted in JiDion getting a permanent ban from the platform.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/3oGeUMvmrC5UvHyAe7QP7fFJwlYKgTCbs2UFvPqfH_Q/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9KaURpb24vWW91VHViZV9QcmFua3N0ZXJfSmlEaW9uX0FycmVzdGVkX0FuZF9KYWlsZWRfSW5fUGFyaXMuanBn><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Since then, JiDion has predominantly been posting pranking or humorous videos on YouTube. Some of his videos show him faking to be a referee for a basketball game; other content sees JiDion taunting the Queen of England‚Äôs guard.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, it seems his latest actions might signal that he isn't finished pushing the boundaries of the law just yet. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Until his video debuts or JiDion adds more context to the claims of being arrested and jailed, fans will have to wait to be sure.
