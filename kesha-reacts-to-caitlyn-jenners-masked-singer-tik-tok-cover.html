She added, “Feeling like P Diddy… I think?”</p><a title=@kesha href=# rel=noopener>@kesha</a><a title=duet href=# rel=noopener>#duet</a> with @kaylum_sharp feeling like P Diddy… I think?<a title="♬ original sound - Kaylum Sharp" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Kaylum Sharp</a><p>The Olympian was unmasked as The Phoenix during the March 17 episode of The Masked Singer. After her elimination, she opened up about the difficult process.</p><p>“I worked for two months on these three songs,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in March. “I did ‘Tik Tok’ and I was going to do The Temptations song, ‘I Know You Wanna Leave Me,’ and I had a John Denver song. It was tough to get those down. If I were to go [and do] all the [songs] at the finals, I would have had to learn eight songs. It took me so long to get a couple songs down.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kesha-Reacts-With-Major-Shade-to-Caitlyn-Jenners-Masked-Singer-Cover-of-Tik-Tok.jpg><p>Jenner relied on son <a href=#><strong>Brandon Jenner</strong></a>, who is a musician, for help as she trained for the reality competition series. “He has a studio in his house, so I went downtown to his studio where I could record it and I worked on the songs with him. It was really great,” she explained. “Brandon got really into it and it was a big bonding moment for us. It was fun working on the songs with him.”</p><p>The I Am Cait alum’s daughters <a href=#><strong>Kendall</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, meanwhile, were <a href=#>surprised by her decision to appear on the Fox show</a>. “Kendall and Kylie, when I told them I was doing The Masked Singer, they gave me this strange look and said, ‘Dad, why are you doing this?’” she recalled. “I told them, ‘I need a challenge! I’ve just been sitting around, I want to do this.’ They said, ‘You are crazy.’ I’m interested for Kendall and Kylie and the <a href=#>rest of my family</a> to see it.”</p><p>She added: “I’ve always told my kids, ‘The ability to grow is directly related to the amount of insecurity you can take in your life.’ And boy, was I <a href=#>insecure about singing</a>. So, I thought, ‘Let’s try this and put myself out there and try something I’ve never done before.’ If I’m telling my kids this, the least I could do is take my own advice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeq5iWerOxwJyrrGWkpHqkrcito7KmXZ%2Byr7rEq6pmpZGouKawjKygp5%2BVp3q1tcpmq6ijXZi8t7HRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
