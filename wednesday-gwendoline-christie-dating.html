He is known for his frequent pop culture references and use of bold, playful prints in his creations. Born in&nbsp;1969 at Darlington, Deacon got his start at Jean-Charles de Castelbajac in Paris before joining Bottega Veneta in 1998 as the house's head designer, per&nbsp;<a href=#>The Independent</a>.&nbsp;He went on to work&nbsp;with Tom Ford on womenswear in Gucci before launching his own clothing label, GILES, in 2004,&nbsp;which he ultimately shut down in 2016 to focus on&nbsp;couture. Over the years, Deacon has worked with an impressive&nbsp; list of celebrity clients including Drew Barrymore, Cate Blanchett, Sarah Jessica Parker, Linda Evangelista and Scarlett Johansson. However, one of the most noteworthy was Pippa Middleton,&nbsp;<a href=#>whose wedding dress he designed back in 2017</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104>Interestingly, Deacon admitted to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2010 that he wasn't a huge fan of designing bridalwear. "It's a totally different discipline.&nbsp;[The brides] don't actually want to listen to you because they've been planning it for years and years â€” it's almost like you've become just a dressmaker," he explained. "And they can't make up their minds, and then their mother wants to see it, and my head starts spinning at that point." However, his experience working with Middleton was different. "She has a great eye, she knew what she wanted," he said in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>The Business of Fashion</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppbn91go6wnJ2mlaixosWMoK6eppSkuaq6xGaaoaqZqMGqsYydmK2hnpx8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
