But the mother of two, 28, is speaking out now, slamming rumors that she ever had an eating disorder.</p><p>Richie, who was once a size 0, caused some fans to worry in 2006 when she was photographed looking alarmingly frail on the beach in a bikini. Around the same time, she addressed her thinness in Vanity Fair: "I know I'm too thin right now. I'm not happy with the way I look right now."</p><p>But in a new interview in the March issue of <a href=#>British Marie Claire</a>, she says all the scrutiny on her body was wrong.</p><p>"I felt it was a little unfair to say someone has an eating disorder when they don't," she says. "It's extremely insulting and irresponsible."</p><p>Adds Richie, "An eating disorder is serious and it's a disease."</p><p>But since daughter Harlow's arrival nearly two years ago and son Sparrow's 2009 birth (dad is rocker Joel Madden), Richie says she doesn't want to dwell on the past any more.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm just one to live in the present and enjoy the time that I'm having," she says. "Going into my past is just not something that I do."</p><p>Adds Richie, "Right now I'm just living my dreams."</p><p>Richie is currently developing an ABC sitcom in which she would both star and produce about a professional woman who balances career and family. Her clothing line, Winter Kate, is also set to launch in the spring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGanoZOkuaZ50aKaoaGVYrKiwMinnmacmai8s7DEq2SrrZ2kv7R51p6pnmWZo8C2uNOipaBlYmV%2BcX6YamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
