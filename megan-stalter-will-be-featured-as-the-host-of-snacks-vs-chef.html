To win the $50,000 main prize, the chefs will not only have to reimagine current delicacies, but they will also have to make their own. Megan Stalter, a Los Angeles-based comedian, will accompany the 12 chefs on their voyage. She became famous during the COVID-19 epidemic as the “queen of internet cringe humor.”</p><p>The show’s synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“Twelve chefs compete in a snack duel, recreating historic snacks while designing innovative treats inspired by popular classics; only one chef will win the $50,000 prize.”</p><p>The show will launch on Netflix on November 30th.</p><h2>Megan Stalter of Snacks vs. Chefs rose to prominence during the outbreak.</h2><p>During the lockdown, the Los Angeles actress, comedian, and writer rose to prominence. She was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1990, and she often based her jokes on the inhabitants of the state. Stalter was reared in the Pentecostal Church and went to Wayne High School, where she participated in theater. She attended Sinclair Community College and Wright State University before leaving to pursue her acting career. She relocated to Chicago to pursue comedy full-time, before moving to New York to further her career in 2019. While she was developing a reputation for herself, she received worldwide attention with her “vital escapist humor” during the COVID-19 epidemic.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Megan-Stalter-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Vulture and Variety named the Snacks vs. Chef co-host a 2020 Comic to Watch, and The New York Times’s Jason Zinoman dubbed her the “most necessary voice to emerge at this fearful, lonely period.” Her hilarious popularity helped her acquire many television roles, including HBO’s Hacks, which earned her three comedy Emmys in 2021. The Snacks vs. Chef host, however, said in a virtual interview with the Guardian that she is most secure on stage.</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“Aside from being among the people I love, I’m never happier than when I’m on stage.”</p><p>She went on to say that even before the epidemic, she never felt ill on stage and never thought of anything that made her unhappy. Being on stage makes her “totally Zen,” and she knows it’s where she’s supposed to be.&nbsp;While the Snacks vs. Chef host’s career took off shortly before the epidemic, she never expected that filming amusing movies while confined at home would be the edge that allowed her to fully experience celebrity.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Megan-Stalter.jpg alt="Megan Stalter" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In June 2022, the comic appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, where she discussed with guest presenter Chelsea Handler about Hacks, Church Girls, and other topics. She informed Chelsea that when she was younger, the whole family would produce humorous films and record skits, with her acting as director.&nbsp;The “crazy” comic will now co-host Snacks vs. Chef, with fellow comedian Hari Kondabolu, in the new culinary challenge in which the chefs harness their “inner food scientists” to put their own spin to famous snacks.&nbsp;Snacks vs. Chef premieres on Netflix on November 30.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3q0wMClq56qXay2rbiMm5xmnpWWwba%2BxJ1kmqtdqbWmeceoqq1ln5t6tLrAnKKsZaaoeqS0xJ9m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
