One of those people was Jerry “The King” Lawler who sat in on commentary. This was a welcomed change of pace and The King hasn’t lost a step either.</p><p>Dave Meltzer noted on<a href=#> Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that the reason why Jerry Lawler was so good on the Raw Reunion special is because Vince McMahon won’t yell at him during the show.</p><p>“He’s the only one Vince won’t fuck with so he just does it and you know the only reason they took him off was because he was old even though they have never found anyone better. Which it’s one of those things where why does it matter?”</p><p>It’s not likely that WWE will keep bringing Jerry Lawler back to commentary on their weekly television shows. Vince McMahon has the announce teams that he wants and apparently, they’re young enough (even though Michael Cole is 50).</p><p>It was still nice to have Lawler back for at least one night even though he can’t yell about “puppies” in 2019, he has way more tools up his sleeve than just being a male chauvinist announcer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>If you use our quotes credit <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49wZmtrX5%2Bys77YZqOar5yav26%2BxKmmq6yVmbm6edOhnGannqHGbq3Np6auppOav27CyKeanmWdmLqitM6nZJ2hlKPBbrLCpGSwoaSdeqXB0aKloGWilsRuvsSupaKnnmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
