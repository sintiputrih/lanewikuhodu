And it had to do with fish.</p><p>After outliving one brother and outmaneuvering another, Henry took the English throne in 1100. As king, he dedicated his time to revamping the royal justice system, building a grand abbey in Reading, and indulging his love of lampreys, a boneless fish historically favored by England’s royals.</p><p>There was just one problem. Every time that Henry ate lampreys, he felt sick.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-400203 alt=Lamprey width=900 height=594 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/lamprey-royal-deaths.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-400203 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Bettmann/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A lamprey held for display. The fish is allegedly a favorite among English royals.</span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>medieval historian Marc Morris</a>, doctors had warned Henry about eating lampreys before. But the king had waved away their worries. And after hunting in Normandy in 1135, he called for his favorite meal.</p><p>Medieval chronicler Henry of Huntingdon described the aftermath, writing, “[T]his meal brought on a most destructive humour, and violently stimulated similar symptoms, producing a deadly chill in his aged body, and a sudden and extreme convulsion. Against this, nature reacted by stirring up an acute fever to dissolve the inflammation with very heavy sweating.”</p><p>Soon afterward, King Henry I died. Doctors apparently ascribed his royal death to “a surfeit of lampreys.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4scirm2aqn66urXnDnpitoKNkfnE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
