Overall, the Kentucky artist has been on the receiving end of some criticism due to these changes. It really all started with his smash hit "What's Poppin." The track blew up, which subsequently led to a mainstream arc for the artist. Fans did not take too kindly to this, and his last album was panned by critics as a result. Needless to say, there was this sense that Harlow needed to go back into the lab and find himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Friday, Jack Harlow dropped <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a 10-track album called Jackman</a> which many felt was going to be make or break for him. As it turns out, this album is a huge "make." Consequently, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fans have been singing his praises on social media</a>. The production on the album is second-to-none, all while Harlow offers some fantastic bars. Moreover, there are tracks where he flexes his storytelling ability. "Gang Gang Gang" is definitely one of those tracks.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jack-harlow-is-back-in-a-big-way>Jack Harlow Is Back In A Big Way</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With this effort, we hear Jack Harlow tell the story of two friends who seemed like good kids. However, upon going back to his hometown, he is told that they have gotten into some serious trouble. Overall, it is a harrowing story that showcases how some people turn down dark paths.
