The amount of publicity surrounding the relationship is a stark contrast to what Swift had with her ex-boyfriend, <strong><a href=#>Joe Alwyn</a></strong>, as the two were rarely photographed out together. Instead, the two rarely went out and when they did, it was for a public function like an awards show or a red carpet event to support a film release for Alwyn.</p><p>Things took a dramatic turn when Kelce and Swift took their relationship public. Suddenly, every Chief's football game became important to the NFL and advertisers if Swift was in attendance. If Swift and Kelce went on a date, the paparazzi were there. Whether Kelce was going to be at the Eras Tour dates was a topic of conversation with each international tour date Swift had. The coverage of the two was intense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-61.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's AI Pictures Sparked Intense Backlash From Stars Worried About Protecting Their Likeness</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans and fellow stars were really upset by AI pictures of her with nothing on spread on social media.</span><p>However, Travis Kelce has received pity amid his "exhausting" relationship with Taylor Swift. Be it from his celebrity being overshadowed by Swift or having to deal with an entire double album of <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> being dedicated to two breakups in one year, it has been a lot for any new relationship to have to endure. While some believe that the football player is profiting off the relationship, given <a href=#>Kelce's huge brand deal and fledgling TV career</a>, and that he is handling the spotlight well, it is hard to deny that being linked to a celebrity the magnitude of Swift can be difficult for anyone.</p><h2 id=fans-believe-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-39-s-relationship-is-quot-exhausting-quot>Fans Believe Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift's Relationship Is "Exhausting"</h2><h3 id=the-amount-of-coverage-of-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-39-s-relationship-since-september-2023-has-left-fans-overwhelmed>The amount of coverage of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship since September 2023, has left fans overwhelmed</h3><p>Ever since the hard launch of their relationship at the September 2023 Chiefs game, Swift and Kelce have made headlines. They have been photographed when going out to eat, at an afterparty for the Super Bowl win, while on vacation in the Bahamas, at Coachella, and even at a celebrity event in Las Vegas where their PDA was criticized, signaling that perhaps, the attention has become excessive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift fans have expressed that the relationship between Kelce and Swift is "exhausting."</a> While Swift has been accused of many things about her relationships in the past, this is a new one, even for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-travis-kelce.jpg><p>"I’m exhausted and I love her - but she is incredibly overexposed at this point," one fan wrote.</p><p>Another fan said, "I’m tired of hearing about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift AND people talking about being tired of hearing about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift.

"And the Swifties over-analyzing everything on TikTok and Instagram is just getting on my nerves. A lot of people have been blocked just because I actually don’t care to know everything about their public outings."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-s-controvertial-private-jets-and-their-lavish-insides-are-kept-secret-from-her-fans1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift's Controversial Private Jets And Their Lavish Insides Are Kept Secret From Her Fans</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift doesn't talk much about her controversial private jet travel which is why fans are curious about the plane she regularly flies in.</span><p>Despite some fans arguing that it is the paparazzi's fault for making Swift and Kelce as overexposed as they are, there are others who believe the two know what they are doing.</p><h2 id=fans-argue-that-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-make-the-decision-to-be-as-exposed-as-they-are>Fans Argue That Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Make The Decision To Be As Exposed As They Are</h2><h3 id=fans-believe-that-if-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-wanted-a-more-low-key-relationship-they-could-make-that-happen>Fans believe that if Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift wanted a more low-key relationship, they could make that happen</h3><p>With the amount of exposure that Swift and Kelce are getting these days, it could be very easy to blame media outlets and paparazzi for invading their privacy. However, when Swift was dating Alwyn, no one got a shot of the two of them without their consent. This leads fans to believe that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce and Swift are welcoming all the attention</a> and publicity their relationship is garnering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s obvious Taylor is doing all of it and wants us to watch," one fan said. "We’re not getting any paparazzi/tabloid invasions of privacy. Everything we’re seeing and hearing is vetted and supported by her team."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-taylor-swift.jpg><p>Another fan wrote, "This is why I’m increasingly annoyed with the Travis/Taylor coverage. It seems like they’re both playing it up. Everyone is gushing over them because they’re so cute or whatever, but to me it reads like a fake relationship for publicity, exactly like Hiddleswift."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"What makes me crazy are the people saying, 'She doesn’t want this. She’s just going to the restaurant with friends.' No. She clearly organizes pap-walks," a third fan explained. "And as you said she’s capable of hiding relationships. She dated Joe for six years, only two of these years were the pandemic. For the rest of the time, we didn’t have a picture every time they went out. She is overexposing herself by choice."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_travis-kelce-stats-and-nfl-career-improved-after-he-started-dating-taylor-swift_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce Stats And NFL Career Improved After He Started Dating Taylor Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce's already impressive NFL career got even better after he and Taylor Swift started dating in the summer of 2023.</span><p>As much as Kelce appears to be comfortable with the attention, even fans who had had enough coverage of their relationship began to feel sorry for Kelce when The Tortured Poets Department was released. The record did nothing but talk about Swift's past two relationships, only giving a quick mention to Kelce on the album.</p><h2 id=fans-feel-bad-for-travis-kelce-amid-the-release-of-the-tortured-poets-department>Fans Feel Bad For Travis Kelce Amid The Release Of The Tortured Poets Department</h2><h3 id=fans-wonder-if-the-tortured-poets-department-hurt-travis-kelce>Fans wonder if The Tortured Poets Department hurt Travis Kelce</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelce has expressed to his friends that he is proud of Swift for her accomplishments</a>. He apparently said that he "couldn't be more supportive and is pumped for Taylor" and was excited for Swift when her latest album was released.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He knows how much this means to her and thinks she's extremely talented," a source close to Kelce explained. "Taylor and Travis admire each other's creative processes and work ethic. They cheer each other on, respect each other's opinions, and are open and communicative."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-7.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans, however, feel bad for Kelce</a>. His having to listen to Swift pour out her heart about Alwyn and Matt Healy cannot be easy. Especially given that the relationship with Healy was short-lived, but inspired many of the songs on The Tortured Poets Department; <a href=#>Healy refuses to comment on the album</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The discourse I'm seeing is that this album is all about Matty," one fan wrote. "You are publicly dating a woman who released a whole breakup album for her three-month relationship when you guys have been allegedly happily together for almost one year."</p><p>A second fan said, "Man, if I was dating someone, and they came out with a song that they wrote a few months before meeting me about their ex being 100% the love of their life, I’d definitely feel some type of way."</p><p>Whether <a href=#>Kelce has privately spoken about </a><a href=#>The Tortured Poets Department</a> has not been disclosed, nor will it likely ever be. But fans are curious as to how or even if the album has affected the relationship between Swift and Kelce, especially now that it is being incorporated into the Eras Tour.</p><p>If Kelce and Swift want fans to know, they will share, but fans should not hold their breath about being privy to such intimate information, regardless of how public the two have been since September 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lla21osHSraCnn12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMCyo6iqXajEqrLTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
