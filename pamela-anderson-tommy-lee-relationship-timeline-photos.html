The Motley Crue drummer began dating the bombshell in Feb. 1995 and became her first of now-six husbands just four days later.</p><p>Not long after, the couple welcomed son <a href=#><strong>Brandon Thomas</strong></a>, born June 5, 1996. Their youngest <a href=#><strong>Dylan Jagger</strong></a> arrived as a late Christmas gift the next year, born December 29, 1997. During their days, there were masters of PDA, always locking lips on the red carpet, but behind the scenes, Tommy was violent. Pam filed for divorce for the first time in Nov. 1996, but the filing was later withdrawn.</p><p>In Feb. 1998, he was arrested for domestic abuse and went on to serve six months in jail. Pam filed for divorced days later, and after that, they bitterly fought each other for the boysâ€™ custody. The duo eventually settled on a 50/50 arrangement in Oct. 2002.</p><p>While things were bitter between the exes at first, they later reconnected as friends with benefits. During the mid-2000s they were often seen out together, and Pam even admitted to regularly hooking up with her ex in a 2007 interview.</p><p>While the relationship was tumultuous, they shared some sweet moments. The couple looked so in love in this 1995 photo taken in London. He wrapped his tattooed arms around her while she leaned her head on his chest.</p><p>Ready for more of Pam and Tommy?
