The format is much like other dating shows we’ve seen before. However, among the eight singletons, there are additional eight siblings in the line-up making a total of 16 cast members.</p><p>Netflix’s synopsis read, “Imagine you’re on a first date. The ambiance is just right, and you’re on your second glass of bubbles. Your date leans in to whisper something cute in your ear. Just as sparks begin to fly, you notice something in your periphery: It’s your brother, sitting in the corner, watching you. No, this is not a scene from a fever dream you had once — it’s <i>Dated & Related</i>, a brand-new dating series in which pairs of siblings (and one enthusiastic set of cousins) see each other’s love lives up close and personal as they search for their soulmates.”</p><p>The singletons show up in a villa in the south of France. The cast arrives in pairs and is related. The synopsis reads further, “The idea is that there’s no one who knows you better than your sibling does, and therefore that sibling actually makes the most excellent wing person, totally supportive and totally willing to call you on your bs.”</p><p>From here on you’ll learn about Nina’s age, parents, job, and height.</p><h3><strong>Nina Parsijani On Netflix’s Dated & Related</strong></h3><p>One of the cast members in the debut season is Nina who arrives at the villa with her twin-sister Diana Parsijani.

Talking about Diana, she was first in class for Brand Experience and Advanced Strategic planning and shared a place with her sister on the Vice Chancellor’s List of Academic Excellence.</p><p>Diana is currently working as a Production Assistant – Fine Jewellery at 77 Diamonds, an award-winning fine jeweler.</p><p>The other cast members are Alara and Ceylan Taneri; <a href=#>Corrina</a> and Joey Roppo; Daniel and Julia Perfetto; Kaz and Kieran Bishop; Jason Cohen and Chris Hahn; Mady and Lily Bajor; and Deyon and Dymon Miller.</p><p>The host of the show is Melinda Berry from “Too Hot to Handle“. The competitors will receive challenges and double dates, but they must bring their siblings. At stake, is a $100,000 prize for the winning family. The ten-part series premiered on 2 September 2022.</p><p>On 4 August 2022, Nina announced on her Instagram, “The secret is out. Watch us find love on the 2nd of September only on&nbsp;@netflix&nbsp;@netflixuk. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as we did.
