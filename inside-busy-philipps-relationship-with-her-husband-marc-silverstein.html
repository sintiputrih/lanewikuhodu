It wasn't a surprise for them, of course, but to the guests they invited. Only their close friends and family knew about the secret ceremony. Later on, Silverstein, who is a screenwriter, wrote him and Philipps' wedding vows to each other into the screenplay for The Vow starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum. In 2014, Philipps told ABC News that she wasn't aware of the fact that her husband had done that, and was pleasantly surprised while watching the film on a plane. "I was sobbing hysterically," she said.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Busy Philipps' Daughters Name And Why She Chose Them</a></span></p><h2 id=silverstein-works-with-his-ex><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Silverstein Works With His Ex</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Silverstein's writing partner is Abby Kohn. They dated for seven years and were even engaged to be married before they broke things off in the early 2000's. Philipps was not a fan of the two when she was dating Silverstein and was a little insecure about things. Once Kohn got married to another man and had a baby, though, all her feelings of jealousy went away, as she tells in her memoir.</p><h2 id=he-promised-to-never-break-her-heart><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Promised To Never Break Her Heart</span></h2><p>When the two got married, Silverstein, who is a romantic at heart, drew up a legally binding contract that stated he would never break Philipps' heart. He had it notarized and framed as a reminder of his promise to her. Philipps told Britain's OK! Magazine in 2010 that "if we're arguing I can say, 'Um, excuse me, can I just point out what's hanging above the mantel!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth Behind Busy Philipps And James Franco's 'Brutal' Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=they-have-two-kids-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Have Two Kids Together</span></h2><p>The pair welcomed their first child, Birdie, in 2008. After having one kid, Philipps was nervous about having a second, which she spoke about in her memoir. Philipps and Silverstein eventually welcomed their second child, Cricket, in 2013. Their oldest, Birdie, has shown interest in following their mother's footsteps as an actor and has a recurring role in an upcoming Amazon Prime series, With Love. Birdie has also followed in their mom's footsteps of being outspoken and honest about who they are, allowing Philipps to reveal on social media that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Birdie is nonbinary and that Birdie's pronouns are "they/them."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=silverstein-wasn-39-t-a-very-involved-parent><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Silverstein Wasn't A Very Involved Parent</span></h2><p>Silverstein didn't do much when it came to having children. Philipps spoke about her husband's lack of parental involvement both in her memoir and on her podcast, Busy Philipps Is Doing Her Best. She also opened up in a joint interview with her husband for Harper's Bazaar in 2019, saying that she considered divorcing Silverstein over the unfair division of labor when it came to raising their two children, Birdie and Cricket. She stated that she told her husband "I have done it all, by myself, and I'm done, dude." Philipps also told the publication that she "wasn't expecting anything from [her husband], but what we ended up doing was creating our own system."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=silverstein-is-a-stay-at-home-dad><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Silverstein Is A Stay-At-Home Dad</span></h2><p>When the couple worked out their parenting issues, they decided that Silverstein should be the one to stay at home with the girls, while Philipps worked and did her thing. She has since gone on to do a late night talk show, which unfortunately was canceled after just one season, a podcast and a comedy series for Peacock, Girls5Eva. Philipps told Harper's Bazaar that <a href=#>her husband has developed a closeness with their children now that he's spending more time with them and that it's really special</a>.</p><h2 id=they-make-time-for-themselves><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Make Time For Themselves</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Philipps told Us Weekly in 2020 that her role on Girls5Eva and "having that time out of the house and being out, doing the thing that I really like to do, has been important for me. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I think once Marc and I sort of figured out how to each take our own time for ourselves or breaks, things got a lot easier.</a>" She went on to say in another interview with Us Weekly that it's important for each of them to prioritize themselves once in a while.</p><h2 id=they-are-open-to-change><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Are Open To Change</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Philipps revealed to Life & Style that the secret to her marriage with Silverstein is that they are open to change and allowing each other the room to grow. It's a normal thing for people to grow and change as they grow older and grow through life and accepting change in a partner or spouse is important for relationships to last over time. "Change makes people uncomfortable but you can move through it together," she said.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Katie Holmes Was Never Meant To Be The Star Of 'Dawson's Creek'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJurtSssGaomJ65qrzPrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdrLa1tIyhnKtlmKrAo63NnWSmmaKYerS1y6%2Bcq6ukmravew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
