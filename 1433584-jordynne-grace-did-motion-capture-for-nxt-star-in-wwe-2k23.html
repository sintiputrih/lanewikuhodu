Mainly because she was set to challenge Rhea Ripley for the WWE Women’s World Heavyweight Championship at the Day 1 edition of Monday Night Raw.</p><p>After her performance in the match, despite her unable to get the win, she received heaps of praise from fans and fellow wrestlers alike.</p><p>One fan took to Twitter claiming that if WWE legend Scott Steiner and <a href=#>IMPACT Wrestling’s Jordynne Grace</a> had a child that would be <a href=#>Ivy Nile</a>. Upon seeing the tweet, the former IMPACT Wrestling Knockouts Champion replied by revealing that she actually did the motion capture for Ivy Nile in the latest WWE 2K23 game. Grace also appreciated Nile as a wrestler.</p><p>“I actually did motion capture for her stuff in the 2K game. She’s dope,” Jordynne Grace tweeted.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 id=h-jordynne-grace-on-defeating-deonna-purrazzo>Jordynne Grace on defeating Deonna Purrazzo</h2><p>One of the biggest rivalries in IMPACT Wrestling was the feud between Jordynne Grace and <a href=#>Deonna Purrazzo</a>. The two have had several matches against each other. Be it one-on-one or tag team competitions, the two were battling each other everywhere. During a recent interview with Wrestlezone’s Bill Pritchard, Grace <a href=#>revealed</a> that the losses against Purrazzo helped her become a better wrestler.</p><p>“I have beat her since then. So I think those losses, they push me to be a better wrestler. They push you to want that win even more. During my hiatus, I had been training to beat Deonna. That was my goal in coming back, and I think I did just that,” Jordynne Grace said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Grace also mentioned that the two have their own accolades and it was never about which was better but both of theirs were and are very big deals.</p><p>“That’s a good question. I’m not a hundred percent sure it has to be a tit-for-tat thing, to be honest. I have my accolades and Deonna has hers. I don’t think either one is higher or lower than the other. She was the first ever Iron Woman, I was the first ever Queen of the Mountain. Which one is better? We don’t know, right? They’re kind of one in the same. They’re both firsts and they’re both a really big deal.</p><p>“I don’t think it has to be a tit-for-tat thing. I don’t think there’s an evening of the odds,” she added. “Getting that one win back on her and proving that I can beat her, that’s enough.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsam5wZGK3sL7DsqWnnV2cv6KvxGabopxdory1tc6nZJyZoKnCs7GMn6arZZ6twW6%2F05qpZqGeYsS4sYxromtr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
