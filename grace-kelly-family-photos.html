When she died in 1982, she was Princess Grace of Monaco. The Pennsylvania native first tasted fame during the Golden Age of Television by starring in many shows during the 1950s. This would result in a film career of even greater renown. She would win an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1954 for The Country Girl, starred in three now-legendary <strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong> movies (Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, To Catch a Thief), and starred opposite some of the most prominent stars of the era, including <strong>James Stewart</strong>, <strong>Cary Grant</strong>, and<strong> Alec Guinness</strong>.</p><p>It’s hard to think that her career was rather short. Grace Kelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry <strong>Prince Rainier III</strong> of Monaco. As Princess of Monaco, Grace and Rainier had three children – <strong>Princess Caroline</strong>, <strong>Prince Albert</strong>, and <strong>Princess Stéphanie</strong>. The three children would give Grace <a href=#>eleven grandchildren</a> in total.</p><p>With her royal title, Grace worked on humanitarian efforts, focusing on helping young children and the arts. Sadly, Her life was cut short in 1982. She suffered a small stroke while driving on Sept. 13, and lost control of her car. She died the next day due to the injuries she sustained in the crash.</p><p>Nearly forty years after her death, take a look back at Grace Kelly’s life, her legacy, and her family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLSzrcKeZKSdnKHGbrLApqClsV2ltbDAzqxm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
