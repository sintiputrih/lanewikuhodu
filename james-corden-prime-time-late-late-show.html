(We really do think he could be One Direction’s fifth member when they get back) They sang some of her hit songs, had a hilarious chat, and showed off her kick ass ability to rap.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzAxLzE0LzQyL2V6Z2lmLmNvbXJlLmRhZGI5LmdpZgpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/a6f971c4/545/ezgif.com-resize.gif alt width=500 height=291 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>James then showed off Crosswalk The Musical takes Grease where they took over an intersection and sang Grease hits in the middle of the road which was hilarious! &nbsp;We’re not sure how you get lucky enough to be on a segment like that, but James, we are volunteering.</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwwimage.cbsstatic.com/base/files/asset/10/00/21/32/late-late-show-grease.gif alt width=575 height=323 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>James then did a general overview of his favorite carpool karaoke moments where he sang and danced, changed clothes, and ordered food with Stevie Wonder, Chris Martin, Mariah, One Direction, Justin Bieber, Sia, Carrie Underwood, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Elton John, and even Rod Stewart!</p><p>These had to be our favorite segments of his shows so far. &nbsp;His interviews with celebrities are incredible, his skits are fantastic, but there is nothing like seeing your favorite musician belting out lyrics in the car with James. &nbsp;Oh, and there’s definitely nothing like Stevie Wonder calling James’ wife either!</p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/15/51/768x403/gallery-1450270424-1d2.gif alt width=768 height=403 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>James then decided to show off the time he assisted <a href=#>Million Dollar Listing</a>. &nbsp;Obviously,&nbsp;he absolutely smashed it.&nbsp;He checked out the pool, the shower, and organized an open house to sell the home in three hours. &nbsp;Tyga was the interested buyer and James was super convincing in selling absolutely all the house had to offer, including a working toilet.</p><p><strong>We’re still laughing.</strong></p><p>We then got the newest carpool karaoke video featuring the incredible, talented, and gorgeous Jennifer Lopez! &nbsp;They started off with My Love Don’t Cost A Thing&nbsp;and talked about insuring body parts – by the way Jennifer hasn’t insured her rump. &nbsp; &nbsp;Jennifer went into music video mode and James had to pull over so she could show him how to properly be in a music video – full with lots of body touching and sensual looks into the camera.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/49.media.tumblr.com/becfa30b31a3e1cc264ae55954e0dfac/tumblr_o4rog2OOFF1r2pp2to1_500.gif alt width=480 height=210 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>James was smitten by Jennifer Lopez’ phone contacts and asked to send a text to one person in her phone. &nbsp;He picked Leonardo DiCaprio &nbsp;and sent:&nbsp;“Hey baby, I’m kind of feeling like I need to cut loose, any suggestions? Let me know. J-Lo, you know, from the block.“</p><p>We may have absolutely lost it when we found out the text actually went through.</p><p>“You mean tonight boo-boo, club wise?” was Leo’s response, can we be Jennifer for a day and have the ability to text something like that to Mr. DiCaprio himself?</p><p>&nbsp;James got a bit sentimental with thanks towards the end of the prime time special – you could tell how genuine he was and how much he appreciates his opportunity to not only hang out with incredible people every day, but entertain as he does it.</p><p><strong>The first year of The Late Late Show has been incredible and we absolutely cannot wait to see what James has in store for us in the future. &nbsp;Thank you for the laughs, the incredible interviews, and giving us the opportunity to see our favorite celebrities cut loose and have fun.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/livimiranda.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/af1a39a0-fadf-11e4-94c9-3f73729b2ba8_larry-dodgeball-james-corden.gif alt width=500 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kt6K5xKxknKeimbKvec%2BroKadXam2rrGMpZitnV2hrrWxjKyfqK9f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
