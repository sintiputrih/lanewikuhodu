MANÁ – meaning positive energy in Polynesian – began in 1986 when four friends from Guadalajara, Mexico came together to fuse new rock sounds with Latin and Caribbean rhythms. The group includes Fher Olvera as vocalist, guitarist and main composer, Alex González on drums, Sergio Vallín on lead guitar, and Juan Diego Calleros on bass. The group released their first album, Falta Amor in 1990. In 1992, they released ¿Dónde Jugarán los Niños?&nbsp;&nbsp;which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling Spanish-language rock album of all time.</p><p>MANÁ is one of the highest selling Latin touring acts of all time. From their first show in Los Angeles at the Hollywood Palace in 1993 to their ongoing, historic residency at the Kia Forum on the Rayando El Sol Tour, MANÁ has established themselves as a powerhouse in the city. Their residency has sold over 165,000 tickets to date across 12 sold-out shows.</p><p>MANÁ has sold millions of albums around the world and has released 11 albums of original songs along with several live albums and compilations. MANÁ’s many accolades additionally include their handprints on the Hollywood Rockwalk and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, making them the first Spanish-language rock band to receive that honor. Their influence also spans beyond music. For 30 years, the Selva Negra Ecological Foundation has been the social arm of MANÁ, combining conservation and environmental rescue with social development. Throughout their career, the band has been a vocal advocate for issues impacting their fans around the globe. Most recently the band joined forces with Dr. Anthony Fauci in support of President Joe Biden’s Month of Action to encourage vaccination among the US Latino population.</p><p>MANÁ has 133 Certified Gold Albums, 256 Certified Platinum albums, 4 GRAMMY Awards, 9 Latin GRAMMY Awards, 26 Billboard Latin Music Awards, 15 Premio Lo Nuestro Awards, and honors such as the 2018 Latin Billboard Lifetime Achievement Award & 2018 Latin Grammy Person of the Year Award and more recently the 2021 ICONO LATIN BILLBOARD Award.</p><p>Their current collaboration project, which began in 2019, revisits some of their greatest songs, accompanied by renowned and diverse artists.</p><p>The most recent release -“Te Llore Un Rio,” featuring Christian Nodal (pop and maricheño), has been one of their most successful releases of their current duet project so far, trending in over 15 countries across North America and Latin America at the time of release. Spanish singer Pablo Alborán joined them in 2019 with “Rayando el Sol”, Sebastian Yatra in “No Ha Parado de Llover,” Joy Huerta in “Eres Mi Religion”, “El Reloj Cucú” with 12-year-old Mabel, and “Mariposa Traicionera” with Regional Mexican superstar Alejandro Fernandez.</p><p><strong>About Live Nation Entertainment</strong></p><p>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
