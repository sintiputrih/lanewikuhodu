Rowling is more devoted to her fans than most authors: She can regularly be found on Twitter answering questions and weighing in on all things Potter. Frequently, she‚Äôs been asked about things that weren‚Äôt included in the books&nbsp;‚Äî like characters‚Äô backstories, the sexual orientation of Hogwarts students, and the racial identities of supporting characters. Although the textual evidence suggests that the world of Hogwarts is predominantly white and straight, this gives Rowling the opportunity to effectively rewrite the Potter canon to emphasize diversity. Thus, she‚Äôs dispensed post-canonical reveals like: Hogwarts had </span><a href=#><span>LGBT students</span></a><span>; Dumbledore himself </span><a href=#><span>was gay</span></a><span>; and there were </span><a href=#><span>Jewish students</span></a><span> at Hogwarts. At this point, no one would bat an eye if Rowling were to tweet, ‚ÄúI just saw </span><span><i><a href=#>Tangerine</a></i></span><span> and it reminded me that there were trans students at Hogwarts!‚Äù</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-947289c9b7943957a85d9f1d97b59b48-3-0-0@published data-word-count=105><span>On the one hand, this can read as too convenient and, at times, pandering. But on the other hand, it can help lead to things like yesterday‚Äôs exciting news that <a href=#>black actress Noma Dumezweni has been cast as Hermione Granger</a> in the upcoming London theater production </span><span><i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i></span><span>. This is an important expansion of the Potter universe, so much so that it does a disservice to Dumezweni to even refer to it as ‚Äúfan service‚Äù ‚Äî meaning, giving the audience exactly what it wants. But in the strange world of Rowling fandom, it‚Äôs also hard not to see it as such.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Canon: brown eyes, frizzy hair and very clever. White skin was never specified.

In the </span><span><i>Harry Potter</i></span><span> text, Hermione‚Äôs race is never specified. The only direct indication is in the third installment, </span><span><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></span><span>, where Hermione is described as ‚Äúvery brown‚Äù in contrast to a freckly Ron Weasley. Granted, if Rowling </span><span>really</span><span> thought Hermione was black, maybe she wouldn‚Äôt have been cast as Emma Watson in the films&nbsp;‚Äî but it‚Äôs easy to understand why this was enough for black readers, searching for representation in the mostly white universe of young-adult fiction, to imagine the character to be like themselves.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-947289c9b7943957a85d9f1d97b59b48-7-0-0@published data-word-count=79><span>On Tumblr, the preeminent venue for fanfiction of all types today, this has led to gorgeous fan art that reimagines Hermione as black, instead of the image of Watson. If you scan Tumblr long enough, you‚Äôll also find beautiful renderings of Miles Morales (the half-black, half-Latino Spider-Man in the comic universe that has yet to appear onscreen) or straight characters involved in homosexual relationships like </span><span><i>Hannibal</i>‚Äô</span><span>s </span><a href=#><span>Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter</span></a><span> or </span><span><i>The Force Awakens</i>‚Äô</span><span> Finn and Poe Dameron.</span></p><a href=#>http://halpdevon.tumblr.com/post/135630878366/help-me</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-947289c9b7943957a85d9f1d97b59b48-9-0-0@published data-word-count=104><a href=#><span>‚ÄúRacebending‚Äù</span></a><span>&nbsp;like this sometimes leads to backlash ‚Äî </span><a href=#><span>John Boyega faced criticism</span></a><span> for taking a prominent role in </span><span><i>The Force Awakens</i></span><span> and Amandla Stenberg received&nbsp;</span><a href=#><span>hate</span></a><span> for portraying Rue in </span><span><i>The Hunger Games</i></span><span> (even though that character is literally described as black in the books). Even though Hollywood still defaults to casting white actors in nonwhite roles ‚Äî Watson as Hermione, the </span><a href=#><span>entire cast</span></a><span> of the film </span><span><i>21</i></span><span>, or Scarlett Johansson in the </span><a href=#><span>upcoming adaptation</span></a><span> of Japanese comic </span><span><i>Ghost in the Shell</i></span><span>, for example ‚Äî the very idea that important characters in fiction don‚Äôt have to be white is still unacceptable for way too many people.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-947289c9b7943957a85d9f1d97b59b48-10-0-0@published data-word-count=169><span>‚ÄúFan service‚Äù has become more and more predominant in this social-media age, when the feedback loop between creator and audience is so immediate. But rarely does it lead to actual results, like Dumezweni‚Äôs casting, beyond the precincts of Tumblr and fan art. This is why Rowling deserves credit for responding to fans who were upset with Dumezweni‚Äôs casting, saying that she </span><a href=#><span>loves the idea</span></a><span> of a black Hermione, if not enough to actually write it herself. (More typical is the </span><a href=#><span>response of Tina Fey</span></a><span> to criticism of race in <i>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</i> over the weekend, saying she‚Äôs ‚Äústeer[ing] clear‚Äù of the internet‚Äôs ‚Äúculture of demanding apologies.‚Äù) </span><span><i>Cursed Child</i></span><span> might very well only be seen by a small population of </span><i>Harry Potter</i><span>‚Äôs fans, but the news of this casting travels across the Potterverse in general. So now that her advocacy has become action, maybe Rowling will follow up </span><i>Cursed Child</i><span> with a </span><span><i>Harry Potter</i></span><span> prequel that provides actual text evidence that Dumbledore was gay? I want to see the receipts.</span></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How J.K.
