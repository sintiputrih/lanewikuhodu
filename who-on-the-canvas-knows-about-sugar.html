Ridge’s brother Nick tried to rescue him but was captured himself. In turn the same scenario happened with Brooke. Sugar had wanted to leave with $10 million but Sheila wanted much more like a $100 million for her and Diana. Nick flirted with Sugar and while she was distracted, got the key so that Ridge, Brooke and he could free themselves. It was thought Ridge fell into a furnace that had flared up. Moments later Brooke had grief sex with Nick when she presumed Ridge dead.</p><p>So, Ridge, Brooke, Eric should know about Sugar. I don’t know what the Logan sisters knew.</p><p>A few years later Sheila showed up in GC/YR to torment Lauren. Lauren eventually learned that Sugar was “soap opera plastic surgery” Sheila.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 2:27pm <span itemprop=position>5</span></span><p>So does anyone on BB know about “soap opera plastic surgery” Sheila or is that strictly known only on Y&R?</p><p>Maybe that’s the whole reason Lauren’s still in town is to shed some light on who Sugar is when she goes to see Deacon since she was a Y&R character</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t remember who knows Sugar as SOPS Sheila.</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Harbor</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 3:03pm <span itemprop=position>8</span></span><p>Laurens still in town?

Something like that. So, depending on how time is functioning on Y&R at the moment, she could, I suppose, have the time to fly back to LA.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>So if Sheila is not dead why hasn’t she come forward?

Whispering to Finn that she thought that she wouldn’t see him again. Let’s not forget that after shooting him and she thought that he were dead but she was okay not seeing him again at that time.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 9:06pm <span itemprop=position>13</span></span><p>It’s just ridiculous—Sheila is not the kind of core character who is meant to “win” or be “reformed.” It also does a huge injustice to the accurate portrayal of mental illness because just like there are some incurable physical illnesses, there are some incurable mental illnesses, and if Sheila’s been sociopathic/psychopathic for literal decades and is still blaming other people for her problems, then she’s not likely to be cured or reformed at this point. And really, what’s the point of her character if she were to be cured? To turn everyone who wouldn’t buy that—and that’s a whole lot of characters—into villains while she becomes the poor put upon heroine? Again, GMAFB.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p>Brad Bell loves Sheila, so I can see it play out that way. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if he tries to throw Steffy under the bus to make Sheila look more like the victim. Sheila’s whispering voice drives me nuts.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 9:16pm <span itemprop=position>15</span></span><p>Sheila just drives me nuts, period. She’s way past her expiration date, and Bell just refuses to let her go already. I’m truly surprised KKL isn’t annoyed by her being favored like that, particularly since she’s in KKL’s age group and has scooped up one of Brooke’s men—look what happened to Taylor and Quinn and Shauna. The only reason I can see for Bell loving the character so much is it’s his excuse to trash Steffy/Finn/Sinn, since they aren’t among his favorites.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>The Tridge tots have been Bell’s whipping boys for a long time. It’s not just the whispering voice of Sheila that’s annoying, it’s the gawd awful smirking too. Really grinds my gears.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 9:57pm <span itemprop=position>17</span></span><p>OMG, yes. That smirk that they always show in extreme close-up so that it takes up the whole stinking screen. It’s also just beyond stupid to have her come back from the supposed dead twice in just a couple of years. Just let her go already.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>I don’t really see this storyline changing anything. Like you said she shot her son and left him for dead. Steffy isn’t going to forget that and she won’t let Finn move on from it even if he wanted to so it seems to me that when the truth comes out the characters are right back where they were before Steffy killed Sugar. Seems kind of pointless to me.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>April 16, 2024, 10:23pm <span itemprop=position>20</span></span><p>And that’s been pretty much the story line for Sheila since she’s shown up—she shoots Steffy and Finn, fakes her death, and nothing happens. Bill and Ridge do the whole big FBI investigation, get her to confess to beeing that guy to death, and nothing happens. Oh, and she even managed to inconvenience Brooke’s life briefly—and still nothing happens. Apparently the entire point of having Sheila on the show is to cause chaos and end up making all the other characters look unbelievably dull-witted so she can escape all consequences once again. I guess her fans think she’s worth all that, but it’s abysmally poor writing that only serves them and their fave.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvWoaZmp55iwamxjJyYp66RqHqsus6wqmaZkqTCtXnSrp6aql9tf3d9lXI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
