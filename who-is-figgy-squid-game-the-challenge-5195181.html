I love the series,’ ” she said. “I am pretty impatient — I reached out to my fiancé, ‘Should I apply for the show’. And didn’t hear back from him in time, so I sent in a 60-second video and I was like, ‘Too late. I sent it in.’ Didn’t think twice about it and I didn’t put too much effort into it either. And now I’m here.”</p><h2>Figgy was on Survivor.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Figgy competed on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Survivor: Millennials Vs. Gen X&nbsp;</a>which aired in the fall of 2016. The season split the cast up into two tribes based on their age, and Figgy, then 23, was on the “Millennials” tribe. Figgy formed a showmance with <strong>Taylor Lee Stocker</strong>, which made her a target and caused her to be voted out during the sixth episode. Figgy and Taylor briefly dated after the show until Figgy learned that Taylor was having a baby with another woman.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><h2>Figgy lives in Tennessee.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Figgy has called Tennessee home since before she did Survivor.
