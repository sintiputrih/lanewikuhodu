They formed a close kinship&nbsp;as brothers&nbsp;because of their shared condition.</p><p>When Lucian was a child, Dr. Michael Morbius met him at a children’s medical center. Milo eventually develops superhuman abilities, but instead of attempting to save people, Milo chooses a more sinister path, serving as the principal antagonist for Morbius and his followers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-lucian-on-morbius></span>Who Is Lucian On Morbius?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lucien, often known as Milo, is the childhood buddy of the main character, Dr. Michael Morbius. Both characters are affected by the same uncommon and debilitating blood disorder, which Dr. Morbius has dedicated his life to cure.</p><p>The remedy comes in the form of scientific vampirism, which Dr. Morbius finds and then infects himself with. Despite his desire to cure his best friend, Morbius believes the treatment to be too risky to accept, denying it to Milo and generating a wedge between them.</p><p>Milo, on the other hand, has not given up on his mission to free himself of the sickness. Milo, unknown to Morbius, accepts the treatment anyway, obtaining the unusual powers and bloodlust that his childhood friend had. Milo, on the other hand, relishes the monster he’s become, haunting the night as a blood-drinking, sonar-equipped, superstrong angel of death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marvel-character-guide-comics-details></span>Marvel Character Guide & Comics Details<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast of Morbius is small, yet many of the performers are well-known to fans.&nbsp; Morbius was finally released in theaters after a number of delays.</p><p>After Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Morbius is the third installment in Sony’s Spider-Man Universe.
