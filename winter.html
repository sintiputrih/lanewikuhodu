It’s one of the most underrated vegetables, and if you’re not already cooking with it, you absolutely should be. It has a fresh, aromatic anise flavor, and it can be eaten raw, sautéed, roasted, or even added to soups and sauces. If you’ve never worked with it before, this funky-looking veggie might be intimidating from the outside, but don’t let it scare you. Once you know how to approach it, it’s easy to work with.

This year, unlike most winters, we got lucky. If you’re in the midwest (or another frigid location) – my heart goes out to you. I don’t know how you do it, but here are ten of of my favorite healthy soup recipes that will hopefully help warm & nourish the soul. I make these all the time, but I want to know – what are you favorite soups?

This year, Jack and I had a quiet Christmas weekend at home. Which&nbsp;really means that we stayed in our pj’s until at least noon every day.&nbsp;We finished watching the new season of Fargo and we’re now onto Homeland (don’t tell me what happens!). We’ve made waffles&nbsp;and cocktails and all sorts of other soon-to-be recipes for this here blog. So far January is looking to be delicious, but before we get there here’s a little festive appetizer that would be perfect for a healthier New Years Eve&nbsp;get-together. This avocado pomegranate crostini is one of my favorites so I…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Two things I’m obsessed with: vegetables (no surprise there), and Instagram. I love posting images of pretty vegetables, but I also look to my feed for fresh, colorful veggie inspiration. Which is why I’m excited to participate this week in #urwhatupost – a fruit and vegetable takeover movement by Bolthouse Farms. They’ve created this cool website that shows how many people are tagging healthy vs. unhealthy foods in real time. For example, as I type this, the scale is about 65% junk food, and 35% fresh produce, but today through March 6th, we’re trying to change that. Things like #icecream…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Are you feeling as stuffed as I am?&nbsp;This year&nbsp;we actually celebrated Thanksgiving a week early with Jack’s family – yet I’m still full from his mom’s amazing apple pie&nbsp;and the leftovers&nbsp;we’ve been snacking on all week. This weekend, I’m craving food that’s a little bit healthier but&nbsp;still comforting and delicious so I thought I’d share just a few ideas: Butternut Squash & Leek Risotto (pictured) Spaghetti Squash with Chickpeas & Kale&nbsp;(pictured) Butternut Squash & Tart Cherry Quinoa Sweet Potato Pomegranate Salad Roasted Acorn Squash with Pears and Miso Dressing from Edible Perspective Sweet Potato Ravioli with Kale Pesto&nbsp;from The First…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>This year, I have no New Year’s resolutions… (I made a few last year that I still haven’t gotten around to). I say… lets not be healthy because it’s January, let’s be healthy because it tastes good. Soups always steal the show in the wintertime (rightfully so), but lets not count out salads… especially vibrant, hearty ones full of interesting colors and textures. Here are a few from around the web that have inspired me lately. Check out my Winter Salads board to see more. Happy Salad-ing!
