Two L.A. news anchors felt the power of Mother Nature when a <a href=#>4.4-magnitude earthquake</a> rocked Southern California on Monday, March 17 — and their reactions were captured on-air. During the live broadcast, KTLA anchor<strong> Chris Schauble</strong> felt a tremor from the quake and made a crazy face as he reacted.</p><p>Schauble quickly held up his hand to signal “one minute,” as he interrupted co-anchor <strong>Megan Henderson</strong> to announce, “We’re having an earthquake!”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=240 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Earthquake gif" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Funny! Celebrities photobomb each other</a></p><p>The two immediately dove under their news desk as they waited for the tremors to stop in Hollywood, where the KTLA station is based. After several seconds had passed (as seen in the clip from the broadcast), Schauble poked his head out from beneath the desk and said, “Okay, it appears to have stopped… we’re going to jump right now to the U.S. Geological Survey. That felt very strong.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The funny clip of Schauble’s reaction almost immediately went viral, with the Emmy-winning news personality <a href=#>changing his Twitter avatar</a> to a screenshot of his shocked face later on Monday. While his colleague Henderson “played it cool,” during the broadcast, Schauble tweeted about the incident afterward and quipped, “Not me!”</p><p>Many stars, like Schauble, <a href=#>took to social media</a> to address the shocking quake, which rattled the region at 6:25 a.m. PST on Monday. “Holy earthquake!!!!!!
