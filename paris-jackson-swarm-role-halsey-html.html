Black?” “Yeah,” Hailey replies. “That’s why my stage name’s <a href=#>Halsey</a>.” As it turns out, Hailey is played by none other than Paris Jackson … yes, as in the daughter of Michael Jackson. We just know show creators Donald Glover and Janine Nabers patted themselves on the backs for this.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>the fact that that’s PARIS JACKSON 😭 they wrote her lines soon as they saw her <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8NL1ASAP8b</a></p>— ƧIKΣY ✰ (@femuline) <a href=#>March 17, 2023</a><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfdc5h3l000q3b6v11abpf9a@published data-word-count=141>Throughout her life, people have questioned whether Paris was actually related to the King of Pop, due in part to her physical appearance (she has maintained that he is her biological father). Paris, whose mother is white, has acknowledged that strangers usually believe she is white. But she <a href=#>told the Straits Times</a> in 2017 that she personally considers herself to be Black. “[My dad] would look me in the eyes and he’d point his finger at me and he’d be like, ‘You’re Black. Be proud of your roots.’ And I’d be like, ‘Okay, he’s my dad, why would he lie to me?’” she said. Halsey, who also has a white mother and a Black father, previously <a href=#>told Playboy</a> in 2017 that she is “white-passing,” noting, “I look like a white girl, but I don’t feel like one. I’m a Black woman.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clfdcvgzj001b3b6vzal1ipyr@published data-word-count=66>All in all, it’s no wonder that Paris name-dropping this particular singer has made quite the impact online. “The fact that that’s PARIS 😭,” one Twitter user <a href=#>wrote</a> after watching the scene. “They wrote her lines soon as they saw her.” Paris herself <a href=#>replied</a> that it was actually the “other way around lol,” so it seems like she was very much onboard with being Swarm’s Hailey/Halsey.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clfdaff65001q0iirj1mcijql@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Swarm Series-Premiere Recap: Killer Bey</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cldkfklrk002v0icecay51245@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Swarm Gets Sticky-Icky</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-fca6268462c96a5e26dcba7575017649@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Paris Jackson Says She Believes Her Father Michael Jackson Was Murdered</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Yes, That Was Paris Jackson in Swarm</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgaHyxrdGiqmaikZi4tLvNZqqwmaKierO7y55koZmcqLK6esetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
