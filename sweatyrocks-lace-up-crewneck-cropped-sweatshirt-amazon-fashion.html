Happy shopping!</p><p>Sweatshirts — specifically<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">&nbsp;crewnecks</a> — have been a key part of our daily uniform for nearly a year now. As many of Us are still working remotely for the foreseeable future, there’s no reason to dress to impress like we’re heading to the office.</p><p>But here’s the thing: We’re not resorting to any old loungewear here. Our worn-in hoodies we’ve had for ages are reserved for the most casual days — instead, we’re shopping for upgraded versions of crewnecks, just like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">this one from SweatyRocks</a>. It’s a stylish and cute way to elevate an everyday outfit in a pinch!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweatyRocks-Womens-Casual-Lace-Up-Long-Sleeve-Pullover-Crop-Top-Sweatshirt.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">SweatyRocks Women’s Casual Lace Up Long Sleeve Pullover Crop Top Sweatshirt</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a>, available at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, February 16, 2021, but are subject to change.</span></strong></p><p>This <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">cropped crewneck</a> is one of Amazon’s top selling products, and it’s easy to see why. Remote working has certainly boosted its popularity, but its adorable aesthetic is surely also a factor in its bestseller status. There are 11 different color options to choose from, and each sweatshirt has unique lace-up detailing on the sleeves — plus ribbons that match the color <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">of the top</a> itself!</p><p>The ribbons weave through a set of metal grommets on each side in a criss-cross style and are finished off with bows near the cuffs. This detail adds the sweetest, most feminine touch and takes an otherwise standard design <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">over the top</a>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SweatyRocks-Womens-Casual-Lace-Up-Long-Sleeve-Pullover-Crop-Top-Sweatshirt-2.png><p><strong>Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">SweatyRocks Women’s Casual Lace Up Long Sleeve Pullover Crop Top Sweatshirt</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a>, available at Amazon!

It’s clearly cropped, which will look ultra-chic with a pair of high-waisted jeans or workout leggings! In addition to the cropped silhouette, it has a relaxed, boxy vibe that’s meant to fit on the loose side. If you’re looking for extra comfort, feel free to order a size up. Why stick to boring sweatshirts when a garment that’s this swoon-worthy is available now at such an affordable price?</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">SweatyRocks Women’s Casual Lace Up Long Sleeve Pullover Crop Top Sweatshirt</a> for prices starting at <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener">$19</a>, available at Amazon!
