She also showed off her super long braid as she placed a loving arm around Marcus, who smiled and said, “Let’s go, baby!” In another clip she shared on her Story, Larsa explained that she “has the gear”, while her man has “the game.” She added, “We work together.” Couple goals, right?</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The reality star and Marcus first met in 2019 through mutual friends, and were romantically linked in Sept. 2022 after they were seen having lunch together in Los Angeles.

Despite the online hate she has received, Larsa doesn’t value anyone’s opinion but hers and Marcus’. “I personally <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>don’t really care</a> what other people [think] – I live my truth. I’m happy. We get along. I feel like [Marcus] is my best friend. We have a lot in common,” she explained to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tamron Hall</strong></a> earlier this year.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Larsa also revealed she is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>open to marriage</a> during the second part of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Miami</a> Season 5 reunion. “I would definitely change my last name for whomever I married, that’s for sure,” she said in March. It’s not clear if Larsa and Marcus have discussed marriage, but it’s certainly clear they have eyes only for each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FpZqWZoqiubrzIqaeepl2irrOv1Kxko6eima6vecqiqqyhnpx6qLvLn2Stp6Wnu6K5xKerZqiYpMGwv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
