So, why was RHOM originally "canceled" in the first place?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why was 'RHOM' "canceled" after Season 3 in 2013?</h2><p>Though RHOM did go on a filming and production hiatus following Season 3, Bravo never officially canceled the show (the network has never formally axed any Real Housewives programs).</p><p>The main reason why the show did not return immediately for Season 4 is because the ratings declined as the third season progressed. In a since-expired Instagram story from 2020, RHOM Executive Producer Andy Cohen shared that the ratings even decreased during the Season 3 reunion special — which is when the ladies get together to discuss all of the drama from the prior episodes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"People ask me about Miami all the time and say will you ever bring it back?" the WHHL host shared on the app while a marathon of the series was airing on Bravo, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealHousewivesFranchise</a>. "The reason that we let it go was, I remember the ratings went down toward the end of the season, which never happens. Like it went down for the reunion, and if it's going down toward the end, that's just never a good sign. But anyway, I hear your love all the time and really appreciate the show and the women."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The face of the network also noted that the impending absence of a breakout star contributed to the decision — though she wasn't an official housewife.</p><p>"And Mama Elsa got sick and dropped out so that was a big hit for the show, it was... it just ended," he concluded about cast member Marysol Patton's mother, Elsa Patton, who ultimately passed away in 2019.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'RHOM' is back for Season 4, and it's airing on Peacock.</h2><p>Though fans of the franchise (and Real Housewives supporters in general) had to wait for the better part of a decade to see RHOM back on the small screen, the reality series has officially returned for Season 4. Unfortunately, a few notable Season 3 personalities did not return to the show, including Lea Black and Joanna Krupa.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The rebooted series, thus far, is airing exclusively on Peacock, which means that interested viewers will have to get a subscription to the NBCUniversal streaming service in order to tune in.</p><p>A premium Peacock package costs $4.99 per month, but it includes ads. A Peacock Plus account will run users $9.99 each month, but it does provide an ad-free experience.</p><p>New episodes of The Real Housewives of Miami debut on Thursdays on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6edaaqmaqmKS6bq%2FAp5qepJWZ</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
