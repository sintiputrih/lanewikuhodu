As it begins, we see he’s turned over a new leaf and become a surgeon in Australia, giving up his life of crime. However, when the twisted Fagin finds his way back in the Dawkins’ life, the doctor realizes that old habits die hard, and begins to think he might not belong in the new, refined world in which he’s ended up.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>The dark but comic series quickly gained a loyal fanbase, and critics were also impressed with the show. It currently sits <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on a very respectable 93% on Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which goes to show just how popular it has become. However, as many heartbroken Santa Clarita Diet fans know, a devoted group of watchers and critical acclaim doesn’t always lead to a renewal. And, if we’re honest, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney isn’t always great</a> at keeping content alive.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>So, is the show set in Victorian Australia going to be back for a second go?

So, even the biggest fan would have already been reckoning with the notion that they weren’t getting a second helping of The Artful Dodger.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=221 data-injectable=false>Then again, when something that works as a one-time series gets big enough (read: makes enough money), studios are always willing to bring it back.
