She rose to his defense on countless occasions, most notably to rebuke President Trump's infamous "I like people who weren't captured" remark that was viewed as a criticism of the senator's time spent as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War. But their bond is obviously far deeper than political posturing.</p><p>In a 2009 <a href=#>interview</a> with talk show host Larry King, Meghan called her father "so supportive of me and my career and what I do and speaking my mind." In 2013, she told&nbsp;<a href=#>Elle</a>, "I've never had an instance where something I've said publicly has gotten in the way of my relationship with my dad. He gave an interview a year ago where he said 'I may not agree with her but I respect her views.' That was a really wonderful thing for him to say. I'm really lucky."</p><p>When Sen. McCain when public with his cancer diagnosis in 2017, it was Meghan who <a href=#>tweeted</a> a statement that said, in part, "He is a warrior at dusk, one of the greatest Americans of our age, and the worthy heir to his father's and grandfather's name. But to me he is something more. He is my strength, my example, my refuge, my confidante, my teacher, my hero â€” my dad."&nbsp;</p><p>Following her father's death on Aug. 25, 2018, Meghan released a powerful <a href=#>statement</a> that said, in part: "I was with my father at his end, as he was with me at my beginning. In the thirty-three years we shared together, he raised me, taught me, corrected me, comforted me, encouraged me, and supported me in all things ...&nbsp;All that I am is thanks to him. Now that he is gone, the task of my lifetime is to live up to his example, his expectations, and his love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmhoZYJwwMeipaCrXZm2pbrTZqKnp6diuqazx5qlZqWTmK6quo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
