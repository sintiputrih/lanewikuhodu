RiRi was so uncomfortable watching the sex scene she filmed during her guest appearance on&nbsp;Bates Motel<i>&nbsp;</i>that&nbsp;when the episode debuted on March 20 the queen took to social media to share her unbelievable pain with anyone who would listen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>The Barbadian beauty landed the part of Marion Crane, a tragic role made famous by <strong>Janet Leigh</strong> in Psycho,&nbsp;the 1960 <strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong> film which Bates Motel&nbsp;is based on. While her TV counterpart was busy getting busy, the singer started a drinking game which she broadcast on Instagram Live. She distracted herself from what was going on by taking a shot of tequila every time anyone said “Norman.” Check out clips from her hilarious Instagram Live in the video above!</p><h3>Click here to see pics of ‘Bates Motel’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“This is so weird, oh my God,” the “Work” singer said while she covered her face in mortification as Marion continued to make love to her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (played by <strong>Austin Nichols</strong>).&nbsp;“I can’t,” she said, totally freaked out. It got so bad that Rihanna didn’t just care about her steamy scene, but the way she sounded!&nbsp;“I can’t hear my voice. It’s, like, gross!” she cried out.
