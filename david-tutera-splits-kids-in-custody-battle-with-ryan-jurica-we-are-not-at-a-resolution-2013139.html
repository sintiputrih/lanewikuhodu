Months after announcing their separation, the former couple have come to a temporary custody agreement over the care of their twins, daughter Cielo and son Cedric — and it involves separating the siblings by thousands of miles.</p><p>Talking with the ladies of The View on Friday, Sept. 13, about his bitter battle with Jurica, Tutera explained the terms of their arrangement. "We transferred two embryos into the surrogate: One was biologically mine, my daughter Cielo; one was biologically his, his son," the WE TV star said. "When we were going through the process of divorce, we decided to make sure that I had custody of my daughter, and he had custody of his son."</p><p>Tutera noted that he "absolutely" wanted the kids to have a relationship with one another but said he thought it would take some time. "That can't happen until the environment is calm and peaceful," he told <strong>Barbara Walters </strong>and company. "I have no right to not have them know each other, but I can protect my daughter about when that time is the right time."</p><p>He added: "My responsibility right now is to get through a divorce and protect and guide and nurture my daughter."</p><p>As previously reported, the WE TV star filed papers to end his decade-long domestic partnership with Jurica earlier this year, prior to the birth of the couple's twins. "The relationship was going poorly for six years," he admitted on The View. "We went through with [having kids] in hopes that the relationship would get better and that having a family would make it better."</p><p>"I have always wanted to be a dad. That was really important to me," he added. "And I've always wanted the fairy-tale life of being in a relationship. I fell in love with Ryan. I still love Ryan. That is a very true fact."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That said, things are still far from settled between the exes. "We are not at a resolution now," he confessed. "But I will never say anything negative or foul about my ex partner. My integrity…is super important to who I am."</p><p>Jurica, for his part, claimed in May that Tutera was addicted to sex, which the reality host vehemently denied to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>. "The allegations against me are baseless and untrue and I will fight vigorously to defend my reputation in the court of law as well as the court of public opinion," he told <strong>Us</strong> at the time. "I believe them to be fabrications of a desperate individual in order to gain a legal advantage in our separation."</p><p>He added: "I am saddened by these developments; I am angered by the lies; and I am committed to moving beyond this painful moment to focus on my professional commitments and the upcoming birth of my children."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaaesW7A1K2cq5ldqL2ttdOsZKShlKh6qrqMnKysrJ%2BZxm6uwK2rpZ1drLa1tIyrsJqmXZ%2FCs7XCmmSwnV2Wv6Z5zairZpmkYq5uvsSspqWtpJ68r3mRaWhsaWNufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
