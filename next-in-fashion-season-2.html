Next in Fashion had an 85% percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which can be pretty hard to come by, plus the 10-episode show saw an impressive roster of celebrity guest-judges sign on for appearances, including global fashion influencer and Instagram maven Eva Chen, prominent fashion designers Prabal Gurung, Kerby Jean-Raymond and Christopher Kane, supermodel Adriana Lima and the legendary Tommy Hilfiger.</p><img alt="tan ﻿france, alexa chung and tommy hilfiger on next in fashion" title="Tan ﻿France, Alexa Chung and Tommy Hilfiger on Next In Fashion" width=768 height=512 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tan-alexa-tommy-1580305204.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Tan France, Alexa Chung and Tommy Hilfiger on Next In Fashion</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Hosted by Queer Eye alum <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a28181324/tan-france-alexa-chung-next-in-fashion/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tan France and model-cum-fashion designer Alexa Chung" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Tan France and model-cum-fashion designer Alexa Chung</a>, the show gave 18 fashion designers the chance to face off in a range of challenges, with the eventual winner - a designer named Minju Kim - taking home a $250,000 (£185,000) cash prize, plus the chance to sell her designs on Net-A-Porter. It was a big deal, and the competition was fierce!</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Who Will Host Next In Fashion Season 2?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In February 2022, the streaming platform put out a tweet to herald the coming season of the series, with the added reveal that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a30699266/alexa-chung-tan-france-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Tan France" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Tan France</a> will have a new co-host - none other than 27-year-old supermodel and mother of one, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/articles/g26824/gigi-hadids-style-file/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gigi Hadid" class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">Gigi Hadid</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Posting a picture of the pair posing at the CFDA fashion fund awards in 2019, the tweet read simply: 'Next in Fashion is coming back — and this season, <a dir=ltr href=# role=link data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/tanfrance data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@TanFrance class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">@TanFrance</a>'s co-host will be the iconic <a dir=ltr href=# role=link data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/GiGiHadid data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@GiGiHadid class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">@GiGiHadid</a>!'</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Gigi Hadid and Tan France also tagged each other in Instagram posts, announcing their partnership on the project and letting any budding designers know how to apply.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">And most recently, Hadid shared a carousel of images on Instagram revealing a behind-the-scenes look at filming for the show. Ahead of the show dropping on Netflix on March 3, the model posted a sweet video of herself on set, receiving an 'all access pass' to the studio – though, hilariously, she claimed it only 'opened one single door in the whole studio'.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Hadid's post also revealed that her sister, Bella Hadid, would feature on the show as a guest judge (more about this below), and shared snaps of herself posing with co-host Tan France – and in one image, the model appears to be wearing a scuba diving suit. We can't wait to see what that's all about!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">It won't be Hadid's first appearance on a show of this kind, as the model has previously acted in guest judge capacity on similar design competition show Project Runway.</p><img alt="gigi hadid next in fashion" title="gigi hadid next in fashion" width=620 height=360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gigi-hadid-project-runway-1643982117.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Gigi Hadid on Project Runway</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Viewers are understandably thrilled about the show coming back:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">But not everybody was happy to learn that Alexa Chung wouldn't be making a grand return:</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Why is Alexa Chung not hosting Next In Fashion season 2?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Unfortunately we've no idea yet as to why season one's formidable host Alexa Chung won't be returning as Tan France's co-host for the next season. The pair had great chemistry, as you can watch for yourself below when ELLE filmed the duo for our fashion game 'It's A Mood'.</p><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for Next In Fashion's Alexa Chung And Tan France Play 'It's A Mood'" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/elle-iam-thumbnails-1-1580463949.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Many fans of the pair are at least hoping that 38-year-old Chung might make a cameo, perhaps as a guest judge on one of the episodes.</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h2 css-1wfsl5s et3p2gv0">Who are the guest judges on Next In Fashion season 2?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Netflix has just revealed its list of guest judges who are due to appear on Next In Fashion – and we have it say, it's pretty epic.</p><img alt="next in fashion season 2" title="donatella versace guest judge next in fashion season 2" width=2880 height=4320 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1389374017-6401d7d1c4b46.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Jeff Kravitz</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">In a recent <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/next-in-fashion-season-2-guest-judges-news data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=article class="body-link css-d2yypp et3p2gv0">article</a>, the streaming platform confirmed that iconic designer Donatella Versace will join the panel as a guest judge, alongside other industry legends such as Isabel Marant, Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing and co-founder of Rent The Runway, Jennifer Hyman.</p><img alt="next in fashion season 2" title="gigi hadid bella hadid hailey bieber" width=6720 height=4480 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-852394156-6401db4315153.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd2">Tristan Fewings</span><span class="css-efig6y e6iqukd0">//</span><span class="css-wudbrp e6iqukd1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Excitingly, a whole host of big-time models have also signed on as guest judges for season two – including Gigi Hadid's sister, Bella, and close friend Hailey Bieber.
