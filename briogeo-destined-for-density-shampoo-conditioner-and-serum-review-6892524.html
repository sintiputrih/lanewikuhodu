Generally speaking, we shed about 100 strands daily. "We are all pre-programed to lose hair," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Dhaval Bhanusali</a>, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Hudson Dermatology & Laser Surgery.

Plus, as we age, our strands naturally lose density, causing our formerly thick, lush-looking hair to become wispy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To separate the snake oil empty promises from the real hair growth heroes, we tested 21 popular shampoos for thinning hair on our own strands for eight weeks. As we suds up, we evaluated each shampoo based on a set of criteria, from the formula’s ingredients to support a healthy scalp, to the way the cleanser impacted our hair volume, density, and texture. Plus, we considered how enjoyable it was to lather up with each one. After collecting each editor’s feedback on the shampoo they used for eight weeks, we scored and ranked each one, and this list features the shampoos that met — and exceeded — our high standards.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-briogeo-destined-for-density-peptide-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Briogeo Peptide Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Briogeo Destined For Density Peptide Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5qQUAdfs_aFn7aKnVzCr7bat9dA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Briogeo-Destined-for-Density-Caffeine--Biotin-Peptide-Density-Shampoo-30aba35cd2114b7d9753fce6903c510b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This density-boosting shampoo is safe for virtually all hair types and delivers results both immediately and over time.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The price per ounce is a little steep, but a little goes a long way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This lightweight peptide-infused Briogeo shampoo earned our Best Overall honors because it managed to address our concerns about our hair density and fullness both immediately and over time.

Although we were nervous about the way a strong formula could potentially impact our dry, sensitive scalp, it was gentle enough to cleanse away dry flakes without triggering even a hint of irritation.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, our usually greasy hair started to look less slick over time, allowing us to go longer between washes if we wanted — a true first (although we rarely wanted to because of the formula’s deliciously sweet scent). Towards the end of the testing period, we also noticed that some of our patchy problem areas were starting to fill in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We should note that it’s a sulfate-free shampoo, so it won’t lather as much as an ordinary shampoo, but it’s still very much getting the job done.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type</strong>: Suitable for all hair types, including color and chemically treated<strong> |</strong> <strong>Key Ingredients</strong>: Copper peptides, biotin<strong> | Sulfate-Free</strong>: Yes<strong> | Fragrance</strong>: Yes<strong> | Size</strong>: 8 oz</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Jaclyn Mastropasqua</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-mielle-rosemary-mint-strengthening-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mielle Rosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mielle Rosemary Mint Strengthening Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/wOZc001S2tzrta7qhEtEQK46RxI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mielle-Rosemary-Mint-Strengthening-Shampoo-463dbebf480b4cbdad7143b29bff86d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: This budget-friendly strengthening shampoo is ideal for curly and coily hair types.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: It’s best for natural (i.e. not color- or chemically treated) hair.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We just as easily could have called this best budget shampoo from Mielle the best option for thinning curly and/or coily hair. Formulated with types 3A to 4C natural hair in mind, the strengthening shampoo fortifies fragile and damaged strands while stimulating the scalp to encourage healthy growth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that a little goes a long way with this gentle cleanser that cleans the scalp and strands without stripping them of vital natural oils. In fact, coconut and babassu seed oils condition the hair, while biotin and horsetail extract help to prevent shedding and promote growth. Rosemary and peppermint add a refreshing scent and clarify the scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We shampooed our tightly coiled type 4B/4C hair two to three times a week and immediately noticed how refreshing it was for the scalp and how well it removed product residue. Each week, we experienced less and less shedding in the shower. And over the course of about a month, we noticed new growth along our middle part, where we had started losing some hair, and on the bald patches along our edges.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type</strong>: Types 3A to 4C <strong>| Key Ingredients</strong>: Rosemary leaf oil, biotin, horsetail extract<strong> | Sulfate-Free</strong>: Yes<strong> | Fragrance</strong>: Yes<strong> | Size</strong>: 12 oz<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Masego Manamela</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-paul-mitchell-tea-tree-scalp-care-regeniplex-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paul Mitchell Scalp Care Regeniplex Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Scalp Care Anti-Thinning Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/zMklBE8rM1NS_96xTnEn3pLNIH4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tea-tree-scalp-care-anti-thinning-shampoo-e77e31dd78df41179942d7ff257a100e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: Our hair detangled so much more easily in the shower after using this shampoo, which led to less shedding.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The tea tree gives the formula a tingly quality that may be too much for sensitive scalps.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to the best drugstore shampoos, this tea tree oil-infused Paul Mitchell option stands out for its healthy hair and scalp benefits. Tea tree oil is touted in skincare and hair care for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial benefits. When used on the scalp, it can help dandruff and other inflammatory conditions that may play a role in hair thinning or loss.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This formula pairs those cleansing and clarifying benefits with a botanical blend of Kakadu plum, pea peptides, clover flower, turmeric, and ginseng to revitalize the hair follicle and scalp. The result? Fuller, thicker-looking hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used this shampoo two to three times a week on our long curly hair and immediately noticed a difference. Within the first couple of washes, our mane looked and felt healthier and more voluminous. We noticed it was easier to detangle our hair in the shower, which meant less strands falling out. This was confirmed by the fact that we had much smaller hairballs in the drain after washing. The tea tree oil, turmeric, and ginseng give this formula a zesty scent and a tingly quality that never irritated our scalp, but it could be a bit sensitizing for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Hair Type</strong>: Suitable for all hair types, including color-treated hair<strong> | Key Ingredients</strong>: Tea tree oil, kakadu plum, pea peptides <strong>|</strong> <strong>Sulfate-Free</strong>: Yes<strong> | Fragrance</strong>: Yes<strong> | Size</strong>: 10.14 oz</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2624 data-sizes=750px alt="tipped bottle of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Scalp Care Anti-Thinning Shampoo pours shampoo into palm of hand" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/k8-RIKx1JknR3EEpDjL6h5wKOqw=/fit-in/1500x2624/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-shampoo-thinning-hair-test-paul-mitchell-tea-tree-scalp-care-taylor-fox-02-e0d2dae58b204c45966912c0ef49f1a6.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Taylor Fox</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="person standing in bathroom with long dark hair looks into distance " data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6TCFOdycs8KElTJSjgBWWAQATrU=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-shampoo-thinning-hair-test-paul-mitchell-tea-tree-scalp-care-taylor-fox-01-d9856b52ccdc4f778a1429aadfd7602f.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Taylor Fox</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-growth-and-thickness-krastase-densifique-bain-densit-shampoo></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Growth and Thickness</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kérastase Densifique Bain Densité Shampoo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="K&amp;eacute;rastase Densifique Bain Densit&amp;eacute; Shampoo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KFtUXNUVujbhOjV21FUrrfYvJ38=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kerastase-Densifique-Bain-Densite-Shampoo-de384002b9fd45ceafc005d46f791a7d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p><strong>What We Love</strong>: We were able to try out a layered hairstyle for the first time ever after regularly using this shampoo thanks to the thickening benefits.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love</strong>: The floral fragrance may be a bit overpowering for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You know you're onto something when your hairdresser tells you that your normally ultra-fine, thin hair feels fuller, which is why this Kérastase shampoo is our pick if you are looking to address hair growth as well as thickness. Starting as a rich and creamy texture, the shampoo developed into a luscious lather that felt amazing on our scalp and washed out easily, leaving our hair soft, shiny, and supple — sans conditioner. Our hair looked healthier and bouncier after the first wash, but the real thickening results kicked in after a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Safe for all hair types — including color-treated — this hydrating and conditioning formula deeply cleansed our strands and scalp without causing any dryness or irritation.

We know that over-washing with harsh ingredients can strip the hair scalp, while under-washing can lead to product buildup that clogs hair follicles and causes inflammation. Featuring a gentle biosurfactant, the shampoo cleansed our hair and scalp without disrupting our natural pH balance, even when we washed our hair daily, and it even helped regulate our out of control sebum production, helping our hair to stay grease-free for longer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our fine hair needs to be washed regularly to not look greasy, but our scalp is prone to dryness and itching. We usually deal with the itchy scalp for the sake of a good hair day, but we quickly realized we didn’t need to sacrifice one for the other with this shampoo. We washed our hair five to seven times a week during the testing period and our scalp never felt dry or irritated.

Because fine hair can be brittle, it can be more susceptible to breakage and other damage that can make it appear thinner. Keeping it nourished without weighing it down is a must, and this Fable & Mane formula does just that. Centella asiatica (a.k.a. tiger herb) is an Ayurvedic herb known for its natural purifying and healing properties. It joins forces with aloe to gently cleanse and soothe the scalp. Coconut oil deeply hydrates the hair and scalp to promote healthy growth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We weren’t sure what to expect when using this ultra-creamy formula in our ultra-thin, dry, and color-damaged hair, but using it three to four times a week revitalized our tired tresses. The shampoo lathers well despite its creaminess. The directions say to take a deep breath as you massage the product from root to tip, and we found the tropical scent to be deeply relaxing. While the formula doesn’t weigh strands down, it does feel like it leaves a bit of a nourishing barrier behind after rinsing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The hydration benefits were instant, and our hair started feeling thicker (though it doesn’t necessarily look it) about a month into testing.

For starters, it comes in six different ‘systems’ that are formulated for specific hair types (natural, color-treated, chemically treated) and degree of thinning (“light” to “progressed”). We used System 1, which is for fine, natural (read: not color- or chemically treated) hair experiencing mild thinning.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The peppermint oil-infused detoxifying formula gently cleanses and refreshes the scalp to remove product buildup and other pollutants from the very first use while also fortifying the hair follicle to build strength and prevent breakage. Using it four to six times a week (it’s safe for daily use), we noticed our dry, thin locks were noticeably fuller and healthier looking in less than a month. The areas where we were experiencing sparse patches and stringy, broken strands appear more filled in, and we have noticed some additional length thanks to less breakage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The gel-like formula has a peppermint scent from the oil that is subtle enough to be tolerated even by those who don’t usually like minty shampoos (ourselves included).

We also judged our hair’s improvement over eight weeks, especially an increase in density and less hair fall.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How Much Hair You're Losing<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you feel like you are losing hair at an increased rate than usual, it can be hard to remember what ‘normal’ is. In reality, ‘normal’ actually changes over time. “The average head of hair has 90,000 to 150,000 hairs, and we lose an average of 100 to 150 a day,” says David Adams, a trichologist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Fourteenjay</a> salon in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While there are certain times when you will naturally lose more, like postpartum or during a high stress period, more often than not, it’s hereditary.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Genetic predisposition is the main cause of hair thinning and loss, but it can also be the result of hormonal changes, illness, iron deficiency, thyroid problems, certain medications, stress, and certain scalp rashes," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Amy Wechsler</a>, a board-certified dermatologist and psychiatrist in NYC, who adds that a scalp assessment and blood tests can help rule out certain causes and determine the best course of treatment.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Lifestyle<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main characteristics of our hair (think: thickness, texture, and growth cycle, etc.) are genetic and inherited, but lifestyle plays a large role in hair health. “Inadequate nutrition, stress, lack of sleep, certain medical conditions, excessive use of heat styling tools, chemical treatments, tight hairstyles, and harsh hair care routines can weaken and thin your hair,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Sofia Baig</a>, lead trichologist at Monpure London. “To promote healthy hair growth, focus on a balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins (especially biotin, vitamin D, and vitamin E), and minerals like iron and zinc.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And then there is the age factor. “With age, the natural process of hair growth tends to slow down, and the individual strands of hair may become finer and more delicate,” Baig explains. “Furthermore, the hair growth cycle may shorten, causing a larger number of hair follicles to enter the resting (telogen) phase and subsequently shed.” This combination can lead to an overall thinning of the hair.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Your Scalp Health<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A healthy scalp is the basis of healthy hair growth. “The scalp provides a nourished environment for hair follicles, promoting strong and vibrant hair,” Baig says. “The scalp maintains oil balance through sebum production, which moisturizes and protects the hair.” That means an imbalanced scalp can lead to dry and brittle hair or greasy and limp hair. “A clean and well-nourished scalp supports strong hair follicles, reducing breakage and minimizing the risk of hair loss,” she notes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As such, scalp care should be treated like skincare. “Scalp is skin and we should look after our scalp as well as we look after our face,” Adams explains. “The hair grows through the hair follicle from the scalp. If the scalp is dirty, oily, flaky, or has a build of hairdressing product, it will gather around the base of the follicle and can cause follicle miniaturization.” This weakening of the hair follicle can lead to hair loss, as well as other inflammatory conditions that may cause thinning. “Maintaining a healthy scalp helps prevent hair loss caused by conditions like dandruff, scalp infections, or dermatitis,” says Baig.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you are experiencing scalp sensitivity, itching, or flaking, consulting with a trichologist or dermatologist can help determine why. In some cases, a prescription shampoo with an FDA-approved ingredient like ketoconazole may be needed to clear up the flare up.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For others, better washing habits may be all you need. “When shampooing, you should be doing 3 things: cleansing the scalp, cleansing the hair, and conditioning the ends,” Adams says. “Do not massage the conditioner into the scalp as it may make the hair oily, it is meant for the mid lengths and ends only.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shampoos for thinning hair need to accomplish a few things. First and foremost, they need to gently cleanse the scalp and hair without causing irritation or dryness. Next up, they should strengthen strands and improve scalp circulation to encourage healthy growth over time. Last but not least, many provide a temporary volumizing boost to make hair look fuller in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">That means you’ll be seeing a cocktail of active ingredients in formulas designed for thinning hair. “Most shampoos for thinning hair will contain ingredients such as essential oils, jojoba oil, peppermint, seaweed collagen, aloe vera, honey, shea butter, biotin, turmeric, hydrolysed proteins (soy, wheat), panthenol (a byproduct of vitamin B), and coconut oil,” Adams says.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Baig recommends looking for fortifying and nourishing ingredients, like vegan keratin and biotin, to minimize breakage and anchor the hair strands at the root, or a pH balanced-formula to support a healthy scalp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Equally important are the ingredients that are left out of formulas, including the usual harsh suspects —&nbsp; parabens, sulfates, silicones, and synthetic fragrances. “These ingredients can irritate the scalp and strip the hair of its natural oils, which may worsen hair thinning,” says Baig.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Adams says to steer clear of mineral oil, benzene (and other petrochemical derivatives), dimethicone, parabens, formaldehyde, artificial dyes, and artificial perfumes.

Do you have a compromised immune system? Are you feeling tired or weak? This could be iron deficiency in women.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Medications for cancer, thyroid conditions, diabetes, antidepressants, and anti-anxiety can all have side effects that include hair loss. Hormonal changes during pregnancy, menopause, or irregular menstrual cycles can also impact hair growth, as can stress-related hormone fluctuations.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And as they say — you are what you eat. “Hair is made up of protein, and we need to make sure we are eating enough protein to support future hair growth,” Adams says. “Vegetarians and vegans may suffer with hair, scalp, and nail issues due to not eating enough protein.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, consider how you are caring for and styling your hair.

to know how to treat it. “A clinical exam is very important and can unlock clues on why patients are losing more hair than they should,” says Dr. Bhanusali.&nbsp;<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29

commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The short answer is it depends on the formula. “There are a lot of bold claims by brands, but they don’t have the science to back it up,” says Dr. Bhanusali, adding that paying close attention to the ingredients list on each bottle is a non-negotiable.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block

can vary depending on their ingredients,” Baig explains. “While they may claim to improve the appearance of thinning hair, it is important to understand that they cannot effectively tackle the underlying causes of hair loss or stimulate significant hair regrowth on their own.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Getting the most out of these products requires consistent use. “To maximize the effectiveness of a hair loss shampoo, it
