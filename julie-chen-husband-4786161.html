He graduated from Bucknell University, where he took courses in pre-med and Spanish. In 1971, he decided to change lanes and dive into acting.</p><h2>He tried acting at first, appearing in small television roles</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>After college, Les set his sights on drama and eventually graduated from the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre. He first landed a small role in Barbary Coast and followed up with parts in Cannon and The Six Million Dollar Man. When he wasn‚Äôt satisfied with being in front of the camera, he turned his efforts to working behind the scenes.</p><h2>Les got his start producing made-for-TV movies</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>In 1985, Les found a home at Lorimar Television, where he was in charge of the company‚Äôs movies and miniseries. In 1990, he was made the president of Lorimar, serving the post for three years. After Warner Bros. acquired Lorimar, Le became the President and CEO of Warner Bros.

In 2003, they filed for divorce, although they were already living apart.

He and Julie gave birth to their only child together, a son named <strong>Charlie</strong>, in 2009.</p><h2>He stepped down from CBS amid sexual harassment allegations</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>In July 2018, The New Yorker published an article by Ronan Farrow where six women accused him of harassment and intimidation. The following September, six more women came out to accuse him of sexual misconduct. While he denied all the allegations, Les stepped down as CBS CEO on September 9, 2018.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>In a recent interview, Julie said she still stands by her man, and even went into detail about why she used her married name to sign off from Big Brother during a live episode in 2018, shortly after he resigned. ‚ÄúWhen his name was getting dragged through the mud, I thought this is the time to make my stand and to let the world know who I am,‚Äù she told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. ‚ÄúAnd it was a sign of support for my husband.
