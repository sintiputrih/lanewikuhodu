In a surprising turn of events, it was revealed that Sugar (who was tricked into having plastic surgery to look just like Sheila years ago) was the woman who was killed by Steffy Forrester (<strong>Jacqueline MacInnes Wood</strong>) and Deacon (<strong>Sean Kanan</strong>) wasn’t seeing things when he saw a woman with 10 toes (Sheila has nine!) be cremated.</p><p>Brown noted that head writer <strong>Brad Bell</strong> had informed her of Sheila’s return but said he was “very vague.” She added, “He was like, ‘OK, I’m working on something. I don’t know what it is.’ And I said, ‘OK,’ Talk about a roller-coaster.”</p><p>While she’s not sure what led to her character’s return, Brown noted she believes her supportive fans could have played a factor in the decision.</p><p>“The only thing I can think of is maybe it’s because of my fans, maybe everyone who was commenting, who made everything go viral,” she said. “Brad does listen. He does pay attention, and in my opinion, I truly believe that my following and my fans and the people who have loved to hate Sheila all these years are responsible for me coming back.”</p><p>Brown noted that it’s “not my place” to question why the “decisions are made the way that they are.” She added, “I’m just very, very happy that he chose to bring me back. It surprised me when he told me how he was doing this and he had to put a lot of research into the backstory to make this current story happen.”</p><p>When Brown previously learned that her character was <a href=#>going to be killed off</a>, she had a difficult time with the news.</p><p>“It was a hard pill for me to swallow,” Brown recalled. “It had been years of playing Sheila, and I consider her my baby, so to speak. And that was definitely not news I was anticipating or hoping to receive.”</p><p>As for her current status with The Bold and the Beautiful, Brown gushed, “I am happy to say that I have been asked to negotiate another contract.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown made her debut as Sheila in 1990 on The Young and Restless, before moving to The Bold and the Beautiful two years later. She’s appeared on both soaps as Sheila on-and-off for the past three decades, earning a Daytime Emmy nomination in 2022.</p><p>Brown briefly left Sheila behind to join the cast of Port Charles, a spinoff of General Hospital, and One Life to Live. She ultimately returned to The Young and the Restless in 2005, but she was released from her contract the next year. In 2017, she joined The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful airs weekdays on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XvK2wjJqlnWWknbJursSarK2hlqq5tHnKoqSbnaKhtq95waumsKZdpL2mutJmrKllkZe8tsCMoZyrZaKawba%2BzWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
