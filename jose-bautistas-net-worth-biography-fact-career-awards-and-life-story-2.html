His mother was an accountant and financial planner, and his father ran poultry farms after earning a master’s degree in agricultural engineering. Jose started studying at the age of eight and attended a private high school, De La Salle High School, where he played baseball.</p><p>He worked out for various MLB clubs and turned down a $5,000 offer from the New York Yankees and a $42,000 offer from the Arizona Diamondbacks. He accepted the Cincinnati Reds’ offer of $300,000, but before the contract could become official, the team changed ownership and the deal was rescinded.

He signed on with the team for a $500,000 signing bonus. The third baseman played in the minor leagues and then was taken in the Rule 5 Draft by the Baltimore Orioles. Bautista made his major league debut for the Orioles in April of 2004. He was claimed by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and then purchased by the Kansas City Royals before being traded to the New York Mets and then the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bautista is the only player to be on five different MLB rosters in one season. He settled in Pittsburgh until 2008 before he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays.</p><p>The Blue Jays needed a third baseman to replace injured Scott Rolen, but in 2010, Bautista began the campaign as the starting right fielder. This is where he would really hit his stride and make a name for himself as a professional baseball player. He became a six-time All-Star (2010-2015), three-time Silver Slugger Award winner (2010, 2011, 2014), two-time Hank Aaron Award winner (2010, 2011), and two-time MLB home run leader (2010, 2011). In his last year with the Blue Jays, Bautista’s batting average dipped to .203, and the team declined his 2018 option.</p><p>Jose Bautista played for the Atlanta Braves, New York Mets, and Philadelphia Phillies over the course of the 2018 season but didn’t catch on with any of them. And after taking off the 2019 campaign, he never returned to the MLB.</p><p>Baustista has represented the Dominican Republic national baseball team who won a bronze medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p><p>In May of 2020, Bautista was named a special advisor to the general manager for the Leones del Escogido in the Dominican Professional Baseball League.</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><span class=ez-toc-section id=contracts-career-earnings></span><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jose Bautista signed a five-year, $65 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays in 2011.
