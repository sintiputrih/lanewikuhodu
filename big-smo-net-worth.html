None of them appeared on the music charts, but still started his net worth to grow. Big Smo’s major label studio album entitled “Kuntry Livin’” (2014), showed up in 2014. The album contains 14 tracks and a few of them featured such performers as Alexander King, Haden Carpenter, Frankie Ballard and <a href=#>Darius Rucker</a>.
