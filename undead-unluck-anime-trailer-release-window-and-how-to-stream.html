The story features two main characters, a girl whose luck is so bad everyone around her perishes and a man who cannot die but longs for death. The two come together as one finds a reason to live and the other a way to die.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>The manga was first serialized in January 2020 and announced in August 2022 that it would be getting an anime adaption. The second trailer for the upcoming series was released last week, showcasing the loud and crazy adventure viewers can expect.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Undead Unluck follows Fuuko Izumo, a girl who is haunted by bad luck, and we are talking really bad luck. When she was only eight years old, she was involved in an incident that saw the death of 200 people, including her parents, causing her to live in a life of seclusion for 10 years, with only her favorite romance manga to keep her going. But when that manga comes to an end, she too decides to end it all, until she is stopped by a loudmouthed undead man, whom she calls Andy.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=true>Andy, unable to die, believes that he may finally achieve a great death by hanging around Fuuko, a girl whom no one can touch without some tragedy befalling them. Think Rogue and Wolverine, but Wolverine is an absolute nut job (so maybe more like Rogue and Deadpool). Soon the pair find themselves the target of a mysterious organization known only as the Union (essentially the X-Men), made up of people like them, Negators, so called because they negate the laws of the world.</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>The anime brings together the crew behind Fire Force, with director Yuki Yase on board at David Productions, the production company behind Fire Force, and JoJoâ€™s Bizarre Adventure. Moe Kahara and Yuichi Nakamura will voice Fuuko Izumo and Andy, respectively.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=542 data-injectable=true>The second teaser trailer (seen above) premiered at the 2023 AnimeExpo as well as the October release window; no exact date has been given yet. One unique point of this anime is that open auditions were held at AnimeExpo to find English voice-over actors for the dubbed version.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>It turns out that Hulu has bought the rights to stream Undead Unluck, with the anime set to stream as a Hulu Original in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6upZ2dkZl6trrLrpqkZZGjtq6xjK2pmqGcmr9uvsSlnJqrlWLEqrrDqK5mmZ6Zeqm71marqGWjqb%2Bmrcxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
