I've seen real cutlasses that were much longer than what the PF cutlass is supposed to be, but I don't know if these is a specific parameter in length or weight that defines what is a cutlass and what is not.</description></item><item><title>Phoebe Tonkin - Bio, Age, Single, Net Worth, Height, Career, Facts</title><link>/phoebe-tonkin.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/phoebe-tonkin.html</guid><description>Table of Biography
