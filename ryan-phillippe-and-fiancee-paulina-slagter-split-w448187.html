Phillippe proposed to Slagter last Christmas, and the pair celebrated their engagement with a lunch at Seaspice in Miami two days later.</p><p>The <i>Cruel Intentions</i> star gushed about Slagter back in April 2015 on <b>Howard Stern</b>’s SiriusXM radio show. “She’s awesome,” he said. “When people see her they have these judgments because she could be a model, but she’s about to graduate Stanford Law. Also, what’s great about it — as you get older, certain issues become more important to you. I’m very involved in civil rights issues, and so to be with a woman who could actually make an impact in the legal realm — that’s a beautiful thing.”</p><p>Phillippe was previously married to <a href=#><b>Reese Witherspoon</b> </a>from 1999 to 2007, and they share kids <a href=#>Ava</a>, 17, and Deacon, 13. Following his split from Witherspoon, he dated <a href=#><b>Abbie Cornish</b> </a>for four years. The actor is also dad of 5-year-old daughter Kai with ex-girlfriend <a href=#><b>Alexis Knapp</b></a>.</p><span class=caption></span><p>However, Phillippe has proven he can be amicable with his exes, saying that he’s “very much” still friends with Witherspoon. “I think more of the problem was age. When we got together we were so young,” <a href=#>he told <b>Larry King </b>last year</a>. “I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there’s so much noise that goes along with it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerG0yKWjoqigmnqiusNmnaKZnpiypnnPmqyloZ6WerS4wKCrnqpdqL2ttdNmrm1saGaFeHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
