Born on 12 June 1974, in Highlands, New Jersey USA, Jason initiated his career in television and movies in 1994 with his movie debut in “Clerk” which happened to become a great hit despite its low budget. Jason has been enjoying his prominence in the movies since then.</p><p>A star that splurged into the movies with a debut hit and many more afterwards, how much is Jason Mewes’s net worth? Jason has been counting his net worth in millions which as of now amounts to $5 million, all of his wealth amassed purely from his acting and film-making career. Jason has managed to live a dignified life in a short span of time in Hollywood, living a comfortable life in a beautiful and luxurious house in the posh area of Hollywood Hills.</p><h3>Jason Mewes Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Jason Mewes was born to a single mother, who was a drug addict and a fraud who often used Jason in her petty activities and crimes. Jason’s exposure in this type of environment as a child affected him badly, which extended far too long in his life. While he was in high school, Jason became best friends with <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>, an aspiring director, who has subsequently helped Jason Mewes in every step of his life, including the initial and crucial part of his career as well as personal life. Jason and <a href=#>Kevin</a> both debuted with the movie “Clerks”, which became an instant hit and provided both of them with fame and stability in Hollywood.</p><p>Jason has since appeared in many of <a href=#>Kevin’s</a> other movies, like “Clerks II”, “Clerks: The Animated Series “, “Mallrats” and many more. His other recognized movies include “Chasing Amy”, “Dogma” and “Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back” among others. Jason also became a part of Canadian television, and starred in the series “Degrassi: The Next Generation”, “Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh?”, “Todd and the Book of Evil” and many others. More recently, he has worked in the movies “Scream 3” and “Bottoms Up”. All these projects have contributed extensively to Jason’s net worth. Currently, Mewes has been co-hosting a podcast entitled “Jay & Silent Bob Get Old” along with <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>.</p><p>Jason lived a dark life off the screen into his twenties, as he became addicted to substance abuse. This habit went on to become extreme and even caused estrangement from his best friend <a href=#>Kevin Smith</a>. However, later Jason started taking care of himself with help from <a href=#>Kevin</a>, and paid visits to many rehabilitation centres. As part of his continuing recovery, Mewes and <a href=#>Smith</a> co-host a podcast – “Jay and Silent Bob Get Old”, discussing drug addiction problems.</p><p>As of now, Jason lives a clean and celebrated life with his wife, Jordan Monsanto who he married in 2009, and their daughter, Logan Lee who set foot on earth in April, 2015.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=24.038038496792><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jason Mewes</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 12, 1974</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Highlands, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Radio personality, Film Producer, Television producer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Henry Hudson Regional High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Jordan Monsanto (m. 2009)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Logan Lee Mewes</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Beth Mewes</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Nicknames</td><td>Jason Edward Mewes , Jay Mewes , Chronic , Mewes , Jay</td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/jaymewes</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/jaymewes</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.27450980392157><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://plus.google.com/107328729890072145066</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42857142857143><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/jaymewes</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/mewes</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0582939</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Gemini Award for Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program or Series</td></tr><tr readability=23><td>Movies</td><td>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Clerks, Mallrats, Dogma, Clerks II, Chasing Amy, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Vigilante Diaries, Jay & Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie, Noobz, Yoga Hosers, Bottoms Up, Drawing Flies, The Tripper, Scream 3, Silent But Deadly, The Last Godfather, Shoot the Hero, ...</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>Todd and the Book of Pure Evil, more</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=48.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>I showed my mom the movie then I told her the movie got bought and that it was gonna be shown in theatres and be on video.
