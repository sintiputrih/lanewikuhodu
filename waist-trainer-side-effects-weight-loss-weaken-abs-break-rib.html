In reality, that's a misconception, and a doctor shared EXCLUSIVE details about how Waist Trainers can actually have some nasty side effects! Slimming down isn't always an easy process. So when celebs like Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, and Amber Rose revealed&nbsp;their secret to skinny waists, people went crazy for the idea of Waist Trainers. But considering they&nbsp;seem a little&nbsp;too good to be true, we had&nbsp;Dr. Sherry Ross, OB/GYN at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., give us the scoop on these slimming tools. Careful, ladies -- if you give Waist Trainers a try, you could find yourself with a broken rib or weakened&nbsp;abs!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/waist-trainers-can-weaken-abs-break-rib-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1878289></span>Although <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Waist Trainers may look great</a>, Sherry explained that it’s really just a “modern day corset,” and the results are only temporary. Like corsets, there is such a thing as “too tight” when wearing a Waist Trainer. So while a super-tight trainer&nbsp;may have you looking like a million bucks, your body probably isn’t going to feel that way!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>“If it is tied too tightly, there can be rib fractures and it can affect your breathing,” Sherry told&nbsp;us. “It can affect your abdominal muscles and posture, especially if you wear it while working out. It actually immobilizes your abdominal muscles, so you are not allowing these muscles to be worked on, and it can weaken them. I do not think it can affect your organs, but it&nbsp;is the ribs, abdominal muscles and lungs could be affected if it is really tight. Restrict your ability to breathe.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Oh dear! If A-listers like&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nicki Minaj</a></strong> and <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> are putting themselves through that kind of risk, the Waist Trainer must be worthwhile in helping you lose weight, right? Actually, that’s not what Sherry insists! She even mentioned that celebs are a bit misleading in making people&nbsp;think it actually reduces the size of your waist. In fact, she specifically&nbsp;called out Kylie for not being more responsible in relaying that to her fans!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“As soon as you remove it, your <span class=il>waist</span> goes back to where it was. It is more an emotional effect when you are wearing it because you feel better about yourself. It is a misconception that it is going to effect you losing inches off your abdominal area,” she said. “There are claims that when you wear a <span class=il>Waist</span> <span class=il>Trainer</span> it increases thermal activity, which triggers fat loss, but this was not proven. It feels good to wear it, but it is not doing anything to help you lose weight.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Wow…from the sounds of it,&nbsp;Waist Trainers are really just an optical illusion! Who knows how long this fad will stick around, but if more doctors like Sherry warn that they’re more risky than they are effective, we’re thinking celebs won’t be so fond of them in the near future!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><img decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Are you surprised to hear these facts about waist trainers, HollywoodLifers?
