Richard Kind, Margo Martindale, Michael Nouri, Noma Dumezweni, and Terry Kinney round out the cast.</p><p><a href=#>The series was made by Ryan Murphy, and it has some creepy American Horror Story vibes</a>, and some Amityville Horror feels. Some of the story really did happen, while other parts were added in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-family-received-letters-from-39-the-watcher-39---true><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Family Received Letters From 'The Watcher' - True</span></h2><p>The address of The Watcher house is real, 657 Boulevard in Westfield, NJ, although the series did use the wrong zip code. The Brannock family was a made up name, but the letters were not. They received creepy letters from someone claiming to be watching the house. They knew intimate details about what went on when the family was inside the house.</p><p><a href=#>A line in one of the letters read</a>, “Do you need to fill the house with the young blood I requested? Better for me. Was your old house too small for the growing family? Or was it greed to bring me your children? Once I know their names I will call to them and draw them to me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The letter writer also knows things about the house itself, making people believe it was either someone who had previously lived there or a neighbor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Naomi Watts Feel Pigeonholed By Being Cast In So Many Horror Movies?</a></span></p><h2 id=pearl-and-jasper-were-based-on-real-people---true><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pearl And Jasper Were Based On Real People - True</span></h2><p>When the Brannocks move in, they meet their creepy brother and sister neighbors, Pearl and Jasper. Jasper pops up inside their house without warning, and scares the entire family. Their first meeting with him was when they found him inside their dumbwaiter. Dean pulls him out and proceeds to throw him on the lawn. His sister Pearl is always there defending his actions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pearl and Jasper are based on real life siblings and neighbors, Abby and Michael Langford. Michael was schizophrenic, and the real family suspected him of writing the letters, but there was never any proof. And he was never found in the dumbwaiter.</p><h2 id=the-family-actually-lived-in-the-house---untrue><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Family Actually Lived In The House - Untrue</span></h2><p>In the series, Nora and Dean move into the house with their children. They are already living at 657 Boulevard when the letters arrive.They also renovate the house while living there.</p><p>The Broadduses never really inhabited the house.

The family were constantly fighting with the couple, and they were told that Mitch and Mo were part of a blood-sucking cult that sacrificed babies.</p><p>A house painter did report strange neighbors who sat in lawn chairs. They sat oddly close to 657 and always faced the house. But no cult.</p><h2 id=theodora-the-private-investigator---untrue><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Theodora The Private Investigator - Untrue</span></h2><p>The Broadduses did go to the police with the letters, just like the series and did not get much help from them. They hired private investigators, but Theodora was made up. The whole story about her cancer, her friendship with the couple, and her deathbed false confession were all fiction. Too bad - she had great style.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest Stars Who've Appeared on American Horror Story</a></span></p><h2 id=a-man-murdered-his-family-in-the-house---true-and-untrue><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>A Man Murdered His Family In The House - True And Untrue</span></h2><p>In the series, Derek discovers that a man named John Graff murdered his mother, wife and children in the same house years earlier.

They used the story of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John List, who killed his family</a> and disappeared for 18 years. He moved to Virginia and remarried. But John List was caught, after his case appeared on America's Most Wanted.</p><p>Same town, different house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-watcher-was-never-caught---true><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Watcher Was Never Caught - True</span></h2><p>In both the series and real life, they never caught the letter-writer.
