This has ramped up conversation about the title, and its connections to author J.K. Rowling, up several notches, and boycotters have found a new way to push back.</p><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>A large portion of the population plans to boycott Hogwarts Legacy in the hopes of sending a message to Rowling. While the author isn’t directly involved with the game, she did create the world it’s set in, and thus will inevitably <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">benefit from its sales</a>. With this in mind, and Rowling’s campaign against trans people at the forefront of their minds, trans people and their allies are pushing back against the latest addition to the Harry Potter universe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts_Legacy1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts_Legacy_spell.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts_Legacy_herbology.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts-Legacy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Hogwarts-Legacy-Witch.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hogwarts-legacy-box-art.png><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>This has largely taken the form of passionate online discussion, donations to trans organizations, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even bullying</a> among the movement’s most vehement members. Some overzealous supporters have taken things a step further and are sharing leaked spoilers online, hoping to spoil the game for anyone willing to make a purchase. It’s already working.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Several major spoilers are floating around Twitter as you read this, focused on ruining major plot points that occur late in the game. This should go without saying, but stop here if you’d like to avoid major story spoilers for Hogwarts Legacy.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Two major plot points are currently floating around the web as spoiler-happy users carefully post some of the game’s most impactful developments. They’re leaning on the death of the playable character’s mentor, Professor Eleazar Fig, regardless of which ending players get, as well as the true culprit behind Anne’s cursing, to ruin the game for as many people as possible.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Make sure to read this <a href=#>#HogwartsLegacy</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/N76zQzsZ4U</a></p>— 𝕸𝖆𝖗𝖎𝖔 𝕯𝖎 𝕯𝖔𝖒𝖊𝖓𝖎𝖈𝖔 (@RichardMcSundy) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#HogwartsLegacy</a> tips and tricks for getting better 🙂 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OXlrZdZWdh</a></p>— in SKC limbo (@tricklengthalt) <a href=#>February 8, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>woah is this true <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7WuQEwNiMC</a></p>— Berry (@bloodberry_tart) <a href=#>February 7, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=298 data-injectable=false>These two spoilers are more than enough to impact players’ enjoyment of the Hogwarts Legacy storyline, and gamers were furious to find them littering Twitter timelines before the game even launched. Spoiling a story is a minor form of protest, but many people still find it unforgivably rude.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=598 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not agreeing with people playing Hogwarts Legacy is one thing.

Most of those posting spoilers aren’t overly interested in listening, however, and are merely finding more creative ways to conceal spoilers within posts, and pushing back against criticism with snarky quips.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Whatever you do, don’t post untagged spoilers about how your teacher, Professor Fig, dies at the end of Hogwarts Legacy.

The game’s connections to Rowling mean that a prominent figure with heaps of cash and anti-trans sentiments will become even more wealthy due to its sales, but does that excuse the sheer pettiness of spoiling a game for everyone?</p><p data-characters=877 data-current-count=1271 data-injectable=true>Trans people and their allies are in a tough spot. Hogwarts Legacy is already doing well, and it’s not even out yet. Streams of the game are pulling in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of viewers</a>, pre-sales are through the roof, and a huge number of people are lining up to enjoy the game when it officially drops on Feb. 10. In some cases, these buyers are not supportive of Rowling or her transphobic views, but in some cases they clearly are. There is certainly a portion of users who support trans people but can’t stop themselves from playing the game, but a large portion of those purchasing Hogwarts Legacy are doing so as a middle finger to the trans community. This means that everyone — even those buying the game as Harry Potter fans, instead of TERF supporters — is promoting the idea that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">trans lives, identity, and safety</a> isn’t as important as a game about wizards.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>With this in mind, its pretty easy to see why Hogwarts Legacy boycotters are finding every way possible to push back against the game. It doesn’t necessarily excuse the bullying or spoiler campaigns, but it certainly does explain them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZon6ifp5a%2Ftb%2BMpZygmZOueqO72JymrayVp8BurdGeZKenp2LAqa3RoqWgZaOlvKq4xKuqZp2eYrqiv9KeZJutpGK2tHnIrWSaZaOpsrF506imZp6Rp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
