He’ll follow Jeff Bezos to a suborbital height of 66 miles above Earth as a guest of Blue Origin aboard the New Shepard NS-18. The veteran actor has already joked that he hopes he won’t be <a href=#>joined by a gremlin on his trip</a>, a reference to the 1963 episode of The Twilight Zone he starred in called “Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.”</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>Instead, Shatner will be joined by Blue Origin’s vice president of Mission and Flight Operations, a former NASA engineer, and the co-founder of a clinical research software company.</p><p data-characters=165 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>As for the suit size Captain Kirk will be wearing, the consensus is that William Shatner’s <a href=#>peak height was 5’ 9”</a>, although he now comes in at 5’ 7½” tall.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>Shatner’s height has been the subject of some debate for over half a century.
