Now that the show’s finally over, besides <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the show’s very polarizing ending</a>, does anyone else randomly think about the Titans? Anyone? Just me? Oh.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>With its intense action scenes and complex storytelling, Attack on Titan is bound to have anyone hooked. Feeling trapped in a society that lives within walls, Eren Jeager wants to kill all the Titans, which are humanoid giants who feed on humans, and we sorta can’t blame him.</p><p data-characters=242 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>As the series expanded, the Scouts discovered that there were more classifications of Titans. Based on powers, endurance, and size, each Titan here is ranked from the least to most strong, meaning each one gets more terrifying than the last.</p><h2 id=h-11-pure-titans data-injectable=false>11. Pure Titans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=861 data-injectable=true>These Titans have been a formidable foe for the entire Attack on Titan series. As the Cadets go to the Battle for Trost, many of them suffer horrible deaths due to their fear of these Titans. The Normal Titans are completely mindless and will do anything they can to get what they can eat. They are the ultimate predators, but not the strongest of them all. Eventually, as the Scouts developed their technology, they were able to destroy these Titans easily and no longer needed to fight them.&nbsp;In AOT, this is the most popular sort of Titan in terms of number.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>10. Abnormal Titans</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>Abnormal Titans are also mindless, but they are more active than Pure Titans. They are faster and stronger and have a larger desire to eat humans. They are simply stronger than Pure Titans for their tenacity and unpredictability, and therefore they were a much larger threat to the Scouts on their expeditions.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. Cart Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=true>The Cart Titan was definitely a threat throughout the anime’s run. However, while we started off detesting Pieck, we grew to love her, particularly in the final crop of episodes. The Cart Titan was one of the Nine Titans that were passed down in Marley. However, its strength is in its name. Armor and ammunition are loaded onto the Cart Titan, and it has the ability to speak. Furthermore, in terms of durability, it doesn’t get better than this Titan. Moreover, due to its build, this Titan is the weakest of the Nine, relying more on movement than force.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Jaw Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=630 data-current-count=930 data-injectable=true>The Jaw Titan, like the Cart Titan, is built to be quadrupedal, moving on all fours like an animal. This makes it easy for the Jaw Titan to jump around and move faster than the other Titans. However, it is still far from the strongest. Its prime jaw feature is strong enough to break through Titan crystal, as shown when it was used to access Lara Tybur for her War Hammer powers. With the strength of the Attack Titan and the endurance of the Jaw Titan, Eren was able to access Lara without much struggle.&nbsp;The Jaw Titan does have an extra advantage over the others though, as it was later revealed that it is capable of flying.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Female Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Female Titan</a> seemed to be the most powerful Titan that the Scouts ever fought in season two of Attack on Titan. She could run faster than the other Titans, and her sentient mind made her even more dangerous. There was no room for the Scouts to run as she smashed them all like insects.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>The Female Titan also has the ability to harden her skin, making her stronger than the Jaw and Cart Titans, giving her more endurance, and therefore more strength.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. Beast Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>https://youtu.be/qkIVRoqhkvU?si=0ABju8QxfABE1GER</figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>What the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast Titan</a> lacks in durability, he makes up for in his leadership skills. He has the ability to create other Titans just by screaming, solidifying his spot as one of the stronger Titans. His height and long arms make it easy for him to gain momentum in each of his throws as well. However, he still can’t handle the strength of an Ackerman when cornered and alone, placing the Beast Titan below the top five on this list.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. War Hammer Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>This Titan had a late introduction but became one of the biggest threats of the series. With the identity of the Titan Shifter a mystery, the War Hammer Titan became a stronger enemy. This Titan has the ability to build weapons out of Titan crystal and can remotely control its Titan as opposed to being in the nap of its neck. It is not the strongest since this Titan was bested by the Attack Titan.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Armored Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=554 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>The Armored Titan was so strong and durable that the Scouts needed to develop a new technology called Thunder Spears to penetrate its skin. These spears would attach to the Armored Titan’s body and act like grenades that would explode once its chain was pulled. One of the first major Titans viewers saw, the Armored is no-nonsense, making him a truly formidable foe for the Scouts. After all, in the very first episode, he’s the one who burst through the walls and let other monsters in, the Scouts needed to up their weaponry as threats poured in.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. Attack Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=767 data-injectable=true>The Attack Titan isn’t the strongest in terms of physically lifting weight, but it is the strongest in endurance and perseverance. It also has the ability to see the future, giving it enough motivation to attack and complete its mission. As Eren learned to use his Attack Titan powers, it became easier for him to transform without delay. In many battles, the Attack Titan has lost limbs and continued to fight, making it more terrifying than the other Nine Titans.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Colossal Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Colossal Titan</a> became the prime Titan of everyone’s nightmares. Standing at sixty meters tall, this Titan stands well above everyone else. Every step it takes could be lethal to someone below. Every time this Titan Shifter changes into the Colossal, the blast is as powerful as an atomic bomb. It also has the ability to release extremely hot steam that can kill. Therefore, it is one of the strongest Titans that Attack on Titan has to offer.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. Founding Titan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>The Founding Titan is the strongest Titan because it controls all the other giants. It also can produce them, such as the Wall Titans. With the Wall Titans under its control, The Rumbling creates mass genocide and destruction wherever they go. Having started with Ymir Fritz, the founding Titan appeared female with its ribcage out.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Under the control of Eren Jeager, The Founding Titan is a creature that resembles anything but human and is arguably the most dangerous and destructive being to ever walk on the face of the Earth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lo6m%2FsLrGnqqtZaSewaK60magp2WRqcGir8pmpqdlpJ7BorqMq5ino5WZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
