A total of four apartments were damaged, two with fire damage and two with smoke and water damage.</p><p>Unified Fire Public Information Officer Keith Garner said at least five residents had to be rescued off balconies.</p><p>Evacuees were allowed to return to their apartments to gather a few belongings.
