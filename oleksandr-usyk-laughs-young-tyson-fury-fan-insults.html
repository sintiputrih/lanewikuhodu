Usyk you're next you little b****,” Fury said.</p><p>“You are next. Me and you next. You're next. Rabbit! P****! 15-stone little midget bodybuilder. Well, I ain't a bodybuilder, I'm going to write you off.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've already done one Ukrainian in [Wladimir] Klitschko, didn't I? And I'll do you as well, gappy teeth. You ugly little man. Let's get it on b****.</p><p>“You may laugh now but I'll end this little sucker. I'll end you. You little sucker. What are you gonna do? You're gonna do f*** all you little sausage.”</p><p>With a monster fight for all the heavyweight marbles seemingly set for 2023, Usyk headed backstage only to receive more insults when his IFL TV interview was hijacked by a young Fury fan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/12/Photo-03-12-2022-23-25-50-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/081A1669.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><p>The brave youngster, named Mikey, intervened when the Ukrainian was asked if he genuinely believes an undisputed fight will happen next, he said: “Do you think you can have Tyson Fury? Do you reckon you can beat him?”</p><p>Before the question had even been translated, Mikey took a leaf out of Fury’s book by insulting Usyk’s teeth and suggesting he must get them fixed before the pay-per-view blockbuster takes place.</p><p>With a smirk on his face, he added: “You’re going to have to get your teeth done first, obviously. Tyson would have you in the first round all day long.”</p><p>The gasps of those watching the exchange quickly turned to laughter when a member of Usyk’s team suggested the little loudmouth squares off against the champ's 10-year-old son in a fight.</p><p>A clearly amused Usyk dismissed talk of Fury finishing in the first round and told Mikey ‘It’s your dream’ before the camera cuts off and the interaction presumably ends.</p><p>The respective teams of Fury and Usyk will now thrash out a contract ahead of a fight that will hopefully crown the first four-belt champion in heavyweight history and the first undisputed king since <a href=#>Lennox Lewis</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraJqfrbavs45qaW9uZ2iEcLvLnqKsmZ6Zv27B0rKiZqSRqrSpv4yypq6ml2LBur%2FOp2SfraKueqetzWagp6ulocG0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
