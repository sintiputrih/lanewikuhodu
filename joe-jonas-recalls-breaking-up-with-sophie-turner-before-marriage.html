The "Not Alone" singer admitted it was "the dumbest decision" and praised his wife for being so forgiving.&nbsp;"We've gone through so many heavy things together as a couple and as individuals and to know you have that support no matter what is just amazing," he continued.&nbsp;</p><p>Jonas noted that their breakup was short-lived and didn't last too long.
