Read on to learn 25 things about the heartthrob.</p><p>1. Although I have a fear of heights, I’m getting my pilot’s license. It has helped me get over my fear.</p><p>2. <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>David “The Hoff” Hasselhoff</strong></a> is a family friend, but I just call him David.</p><p>3. When I was a kid, I thought about being a photographer. I used to run around with my Polaroid and snap pictures of whatever I could find.</p><p>4. My career as a race car driver started at 14, driving a Formula Ford in Holland.</p><p>5. Japan is the No. 1 destination on my bucket list.</p><p>6. One snack I can’t live without: RxBars. I’m constantly finding them in my traveling bags and my car.</p><p>7. Starting from childhood, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Michael Jackson</strong></a> remains one of my favorite artists.</p><p>8. My current playlist is full of <a href=#><strong>Lana Del Rey</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> and my new fave artist, <a href=# rel=noopener>Camila Cabello</a>.</p><p>9. Last year I was in the top 250 grossing real estate agents in Arizona. If you’re looking for a realtor, you know who to call!</p><p>10. Shades of blue are pretty much the contents of my closet. When you know what works for you, stick to it.</p><p>11. One of my most meaningful moments in life was going to Iraq on a goodwill tour to visit the U.S. troops in 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arie.jpg><p>12. I don’t cry often, but when I do it seems to be on an airplane watching a movie.</p><p>13. If I had to identify myself with any animal it would be the sloth. I have long, sloth-like limbs.</p><p>14. My tattoo “24601” commemorates my connection to Les Misérables’ Jean Valjean.</p><p>15. Most people think since I race I would like sports cars. But I’m more of a truck guy.</p><p>16. I’m an architecture nerd. Anytime I walk into a new space, I appreciate the building structure or style.</p><p>17. The last book I purchased was Are You Smart Enough to Work at Google?. I don’t have an answer for you yet, but stay tuned for a possible career move.</p><p>18. One of my first jobs was making pizzas. I considered my pepperoni placement pretty artistic.</p><p>19. My guilty pleasure is reality TV. I get sucked into pretty much any home improvement show and, of course, The Bachelor!</p><p>20. I have a chalkboard wall in my house. It’s the hit of every dinner party I host.</p><p>21. I love The Notebook&nbsp;— what can I say, I’m a romantic. I even read the book before it became a movie.</p><p>22. I fell in love with Thai food after my best friend’s destination wedding in Thailand last year. Green curry all the way!</p><p>23. I love collecting watches. It’s the one thing I can wear with the race suit. And beating the clock is something I’m always trying to do on the track.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. Something I never travel without is my nice leather backpack and a good cardigan.</p><p>25. I’m close not only with fellow Bachelor <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sean Lowe</strong></a>, but also with his parents. His mom is in my phone as “Mom,” which can get confusing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmaeq3B2J6lnbGbYrezeZFuZK2gmaO0tHnYqKxmnJ%2BjwW63zaiuZpmSpMK1ecyeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
