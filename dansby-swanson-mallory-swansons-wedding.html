Rather than a traditional sit-down dinner, they chose a variety of dining stations that were available all night and had their favorite dishes. The bride’s dress was specially made by <strong>Anne Barge</strong>, while Jason of Beverly Hills created the couple’s rings. In addition, each of Pugh’s bridesmaids received an Air Force One as a gift.</p><p>Guests gathered for the reception after the ceremony since the primary purpose was to get everyone on the dance floor all night. Swanson and Pugh dressed into the Shoe Surgeon’s specially designed dancing Nikes. The wedding included refined, fashionable nuptials with traditional, timelessly beautiful details. The newlyweds added amusing string lights, romantic crystal chandeliers, and a stunning white altar designed after church windows.</p><p>We wish to see Dansby Swanson and Mallory Swanson together for many years ahead.
