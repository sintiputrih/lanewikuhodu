But in a new digital cover story for BAZAAR.com, the supermodel and mom pulls back the curtainâ€”though not too much. She doesn't address the rumors of her highly suspected breakup from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25807852/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bradley Cooper" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Bradley Cooper</a> (which the couple still hasn't publicly addressed), but she does touch on the topic of marriage.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Everyone looks at it differently," she said of the institution. "Do I believe in marriage? Yes, of course. I'm not the kind of person who is against it." Shayk doesn't, however, go further about wanting to get married herself.</p><img alt="The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes On Fashion - Arrivals" title="The 2019 Met Gala Celebrating Camp: Notes On Fashion - Arrivals" width=3288 height=4920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/irina-shayk-arrives-for-the-2019-met-gala-celebrating-camp-news-photo-1147526305-1562799490.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Karwai Tang</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Shayk attends the Met Gala solo on May 6.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">All eyes were on Shayk and Cooper's relationship earlier this year, especially as the actor and his co-star Lady Gaga made a number of joint appearances for their film, A Star Is Born. (And let's not forget that buzzed-about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a26503667/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-shallow-oscars-2019/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oscars performance" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Oscars performance</a>.) Months later, in early June, the hype sparked back up again when reports broke that Shayk and Cooper <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/movies/bradley-cooper-irina-shayk-split/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="parted ways" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">parted ways</a> after four years together.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shayk has remained tight-lipped about the speculation, but she understands the general fixation on her personal life. "I think it's just human beings: if you cannot have it, you want to have it," she told BAZAAR.com before the breakup rumors broke. "There's a curtain there, you want to open the curtain. It's curiosity I guess."</p><h6 class="css-x7mxm2 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Whether she's single or not, anyone trying to make an impression on Shayk should go for old-school romance. "Nobody's sending letters to anyone anymore," she explained. "I really believe if you go for dinner with somebody, you don't have to send them a text or keep them updated on Instagram message. You freaking pick up the phone, call and say, 'Let's have dinner.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But ditch the roses. "Every time people send me flowers, I'm like, just send me a tomato plant!" she said.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
