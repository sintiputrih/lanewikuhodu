Leotta said: “My phone would not stop ringing with calls, messages, WhatsApp. I didn’t cry at first. I found strength I didn’t even know I had. But after three days, yes, I succumbed.</p><p>“Those photos maybe I sent to someone, perhaps a couple of them. I hadn’t seen the pictures for years. I thought I had deleted them. I wouldn’t even describe them as sexy. I became aware that they were part of my private archive. Someone must have intentionally hacked into my iCloud account.”</p><p>But Leotta said that she felt no regrets or guilt over what happened to her and urged other victims of hacking abuse to follow her example.</p><p>She added: “I want to say to the girls or the boys who have experienced the same thing, that you should not feel guilty. Everyone has the right to do what they want with their life, their privacy and their mobiles.”</p><p>The popular presenter said that she had even been accused “by less intelligent and sensitive people” of leaking the photographs herself for the publicity. But Leotta insisted: “It seems clear that the road I want to take is very different.”</p><p>After her pictures were leaked online, Leotta was supported by Italian footballer Mario Balotelli, 26, who said: “Everyone is free to do what they want with their body, for better or worse. People who abused this situation are a**holes.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=diletta-leotta-facebook></span> Diletta Leotta Facebook<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=diletta-leotta-twitter></span> Diletta Leotta Twitter<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by DilettaLeotta</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=diletta-leotta-instagram></span> Diletta Leotta Instagram<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZobK1wMBmo56npKmubq7IqGSwoZueeqKzxGafrquSlrulec%2BaqZ6mpKh6p63MoqOyZZiatqi002aknpmjqr%2BmucSnq6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZaCWv7W6xKtkoqajqa6ovsCmZJqmlGK9qbvTqKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
