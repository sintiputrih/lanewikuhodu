"It's such a compliment, you know? It's funny: when I don't wear makeup, nobody ever mistakes me for Jess, but whenever I put makeup on and look half-presentable, it's, 'Ah! Jessica Chastain,'" Howard, 34, told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> at the Tuesday, June , premiere of Jurassic World in L.A.</p><p>Howard's reply to those who mistake her for her costar in The Help? "I'm like, 'Thank you, I must look hygienic today,'" she joked.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a>'s Jurassic World costar and pal Chastain, 38, poked fun at their incessant cases of mistaken identity earlier this week with a Dubsmash video. In the clip, posted to Chastain's Instagram, Howard recreated the <a href=#>hilariously viral "I Am Not Jessica Chastain" song</a> originated online by Legolambs.</p><p>"Everyone get it yet? ðŸ™‚ performance by #BryceDallasHoward not #JessicaChastain," Chastain wrote as her Instagram caption Tuesday.</p><p>"My friend emailed me about that [Legolambs] video yesterday. I was like, 'This is brilliant!'" Howard recalled to <strong>Us</strong>. "We did a Dubsmash, and Jessica was dying. She was like, 'Okay, this is totally a thing. We need to use this power for good and do a movie together playing sisters!'"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>There are, however, two people who have â€“ shockingly! â€“ never mixed up the two actresses. "My kids are the only ones who have not mistaken me for Jessica Chastain," Howard said of Theo, 8, and Beatrice, 3. "I cannot say the same for my parents, though."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmrsZOaeqWty6WYrGWYpMSivsNmoKxlnqTBbrbErKqim5FisKmt0q2YoqZdl8K1ecisZJ%2BkkanBpr7EnWSapqmsrrp5kWlobmlga3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
