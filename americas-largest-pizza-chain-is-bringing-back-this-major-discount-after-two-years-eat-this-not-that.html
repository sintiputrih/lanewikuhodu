From tipping its customers to handle their own “pizza deliveries” to handing out “surprise frees” instead of surprise fees, it’s no wonder the international quick-service brand has risen to become the largest pizza chain in the world.</p><p>But this week, Domino’s has a special kind of treat—it’s bringing back what it calls “boost week,” one of the most popular deals to date. And that means 50% off pizzas ordered online! The deal will be in effect today through Sunday, June 12.</p><p>The company hasn’t offered this half-off promotion in more than two years. After all, it reported an astounding 16% increase in overall sales in the early days of the pandemic. But this year’s first-quarter performance reveals that same-store sales are slipping—largely due to waning demand, shortage of delivery drivers, and inflation.</p><p>Enter the 50% discount, a strategy that has helped the chain churn out strong sales for many consecutive years. According to Restaurant Business, Domino’s CEO Russell Weiner said, “We haven’t done boost weeks in a couple of years. And boost weeks really is what drives new customers into Domino’s. That’s where the magic happens with our loyalty program and all our digital and analytical capability.”</p><p>The discount applies to all pizzas at menu price, and is available exclusively online. Customers can place their orders on the official website or through the Domino’s app. And if you take advantage, remember to thank your local staff.</p><p>Over in the Domino’s subreddit, user starshine913 wrote: “EMPLOYEES: GOOD LUCK THIS WEEK!” to which a few other users responded with their sales thus far—like $4,800 by dinner rush, and $8,600 on the first day. How the rest of the week pans out remains to be seen, but the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based pizza chain feels good about the timing.<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><p>“With wallets being squeezed and summer gatherings starting up, we thought this was a good time to bring back this tremendous deal,” Joe Jordan, Domino’s president of U.S. and global services, said in a statement.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/themes/eatthis/img/etnt-logo.png alt="Eat this, not that" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><br>Sign up for our newsletter!</p><p>Melissa Fiorenza</p><p>Melissa Fiorenza has been writing for over a decade on a range of topics, including mental health, nutrition, fitness, parenting, and women’s issues.Read more</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vAppyroZOWwG64wKuenqukYr2qxtmaZJygkZ67brXSZpmroZ6ctq%2BzjJuYnKNdqbWqv4ymmKOnomKxqr%2FCqKynrF2Ws7Wx0WarsKddrrKivtJmnJqsXam1qr%2BMp6atZaSdrrV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
