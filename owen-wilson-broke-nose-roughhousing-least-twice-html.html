The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoolander</a>&nbsp;star’s nose gives him a distinct look that is easily recognizable on its own. But Wilson wasn’t born with his iconic facial feature.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_28>The actor broke his nose on two separate occasions. And according to him, it occurred while roughhousing.

The actor opened up about his favorite roles, working with his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">good friend Ben Stiller</a>, and whether or not he’s Australian. Wilson believes that, as a Texan, he has a similar mindset as those from down under.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_10>One of the questions had to do with his nose.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_59>“How did Owen Wilson get his nose broken?” the actor read the question aloud. “At [the] University of Texas,” he confirmed, citing his alma mater. “Playing, we were doing intramural flag football, and I got banged.” However, it wasn’t the first time he injured his nose. “But also, I think just like, as a kid, just roughhousing,'” he added.</p><p id=par-6_21>While most of us bear scars and scrapes from our youth, few make it part of our signature look, like Wilson.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-wilson-s-nose-is-a-big-part-of-who-he-is>Wilson’s nose is a big part of who he is</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_23>According to a 2001 interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a>, Owen Wilson’s nose garners unsolicited comments. But it also helps him achieve his legendary look.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_50>“You look kind of odd, disfigured,” the&nbsp;Shanghai Noon&nbsp;actor told the publication of a comment he sometimes receives from others. However, Wilson doesn’t view it as a negative. He likes the fact that it adds some character to a nose that would, otherwise, may not have stood out in the crowd.</p><p id=par-9_18>“You know, probably my nose wouldn’t have been that great even if it hadn’t been broken,” he noted.</p><p id=par-10_57>Owen faced other adversity he used to “define” himself. His brother, Luke Wilson, told the publication going to military school changed his famous sibling and gave him connections. “He dealt with the adversity of getting expelled,” his&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>&nbsp;co-star noted. At military school in New Mexico, “he met a kid that later introduced him to Wes [Anderson].”</p><h2 id=h-more-iconic-celebrity-noses>More iconic celebrity noses</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_36>Wilson is far from the only celebrity with a notable nose.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrien Brody</a>&nbsp;is known for his similarly distinctive nose, though he doesn’t often address it in interviews.

The King of Pop reportedly underwent multiple surgeries on his nose, resulting in a frequently changing appearance. At the time of his death, there wasn’t much left of it.</p><p id=par-14_32>Every nose is different, and Wilson knows how to address this casually. Rather than treat a particular nose as flawed, perhaps people can see them as another unique feature on the face.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS8uLHNZq6ipKOku26u0aiinmWepMCmedGorKCgmKTCtLXNoGSlnZGowW7A1qKanmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
