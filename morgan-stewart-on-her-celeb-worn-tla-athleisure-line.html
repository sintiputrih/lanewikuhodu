The 30-year-old, known for her sharp sense of humor and envy-worthy style, put the two together to create <a href=#>TLA by Morgan Stewart</a> in 2017.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Her famous workout sets that double as athleisure wear have been seen on celebs like <strong><a href=#>Khloé Kardashian</a></strong>,<a href=#><strong> Olivia Culpo</strong></a>, <strong>Devon Windsor</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Ariel Winter</strong></a>, <strong>Bea Miller</strong>, <strong>Vanessa Morgan</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> and probably that girl in your workout class whose outfit you can’t stop admiring.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Since TLA’s launch, the brand has always been ahead of the trends dropping sets in bright neon colors and snakeskin patterns before everyone got on board. The latest? Flowery prints in dreamy pastel colors.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I thought these designs were really sweet and that’s what I wanted,” Stewart told Stylish. And while the designs on her newest spring 2019 sets are cute and girly, they’re made to look sexy and fashionable on everybody.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I didn’t work out a lot before I had this line and I always wanted to find the perfect high-waisted leggings. The leggings I was finding typically had bulkier seams, were too heavy or would ride up,” Stewart admitted.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/olivia-culpo-workout.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>“On what planet do people want their stomach to show? I’m not <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a> in 2005,” the Daily Pop co-host joked.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I love that the TLA’s pieces are seamless because it makes them seem a little bit more high-end, something you can wear out and something that anybody could pull off regardless of their size.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Even though her line hasn’t made her a full-on workout fanatic yet (she swears by Pilates twice a week), you can find her in a pair of good leggings every morning.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“Whether I’m going to work out or going to work, I’m always in a pair of leggings. I’ll wear them before I get into my wardrobe, hair and makeup and all around,” she said.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Morgan-Stewart-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>And the TLA gear fits in perfectly with Stewart’s sense of fashion because she typically likes to keep her look consistent and effortless. “I wear jeans a blouse and jacket for a date night with my husband [<strong>Brendan Fitzpatrick</strong>] usually, but if we’re going somewhere special, I’ll switch it up,” she said.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>”He’s into the dressed-down or the dressed-up Morgan. We both have a sense of fashion and enjoy clothes and I think he understands what I like to wear and appreciates my taste overall, and if he didn’t, I’d kill him,” she teased.</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for additional items she can’t wait to rock this spring? “I always love denim shorts in the warmer months. I’m excited to wear floral dresses and more structured pieces like power blazers,” she spilled.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>But don’t expect her to copy anyone’s get-ups anytime soon. “I feel like I set my own trends and if something catches my eye, that’s what I’ll wear. I don’t like to wear something after someone else already has.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6K8s7PAp2SsrJWsrrPAjKilZqCVp3qkscuemWavn6e7bsDLmmSarJihsqq%2F1KucZqSZo7Jw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
