They said he set the fire at his own home to destroy evidence and to make it look like the extended family was being targeted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni says the financial motive stemmed from two businesses the brothers ran in Asbury Park, a technology firm and a pest control company. He says he cannot detail their financial picture.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Paul Caneiro is now charged with murder in the deaths of 50-year-old Keith Caneiro, his 45-year-old wife Jennifer and their children, 11-year-old Jesse and 8-year-old Sophia.

The criminal complaint indicates Paul Caneiro may have used the seized knife to stab one or more of the other three victims.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The criminal complaint does not indicate a motive.
