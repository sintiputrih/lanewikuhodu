The actor has played Batman’s nemesis <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the Joker</strong></a> across numerous media for over 25 years now, beginning with the acclaimed&nbsp;Batman: The Animated Series&nbsp;in 1992. To many, his vocal performance perfectly captures all aspects of the supervillain:&nbsp;his charm and humour, yet also his monstrous, murderous side.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>In an interview with Sway’s Universe, Hamill&nbsp;talked about&nbsp;where exactly his portrayal of the Joker comes from. The star revealed that, back when he started doing&nbsp;B:TAS, he was influenced by a strange mix of inspirations, including classic black-and-white horror&nbsp;The Invisible Man&nbsp;and TV personalities like Howard Cosell and Jay Leno.</p><p>“I would imitate the old Universal horror films and I realize, in retrospect, I wasn’t doing it consciously, but Claude Rains as The Invisible Man…[imitates Rains] ‘Crazy? You think I’m crazy? I’ll show you who’s crazy!’ So he had sort of the grit that I incorporated into it and I said to voiceover people later, I would do a character, and I would say, ‘It’s&nbsp;sort of like Howard Cosell meets Jay Leno, is that a cheat?’ And they said, ‘No, we do that all the time.'”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/HEP6526cb_26mark_hamill_voices_joker_discussio-641x360.png alt=The-joker-mark-hamill-batman-the-animated-series width=640 height=359 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Drawing inspiration from old horror movies is definitely a good starting point to play the Joker. It’s a well-known fact that co-creator Bill Finger was influenced by 1928’s&nbsp;The Man Who Laughs&nbsp; – about a disfigured man with a bleached face and a permanent grin – when coming up with the Clown Prince of Crime’s look. Likewise, once you marry that old-timey horror vibe with the showmanship of a talk show host like Jay Leno, you can begin to see why Hamill’s take on the character is so spot-on.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>The actor&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously opened up</a> about how instrumental getting the Joker’s laugh right was in him landing the part. Initially, he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thought his&nbsp;Star Wars fame</a>&nbsp;would prevent him from being cast, but luck came his way when the original choice, Tim Curry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">backed out of the TV series</a>.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=false>Now, a quarter of a century later and Mark Hamill is still voicing <strong>the Joker</strong>, most recently in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the&nbsp;Justice League Action&nbsp;YouTube shorts</a>. And with the way things seem to be going, we imagine he’ll be performing the role for many more years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdGkZKGZnZ65rXnJqKKeql2eu7S8yKuYraGfo8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
