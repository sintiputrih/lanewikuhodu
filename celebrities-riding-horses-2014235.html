From <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> in&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Runaway Bride</a>&nbsp;</i>to <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong> </a>relaxing around the corral, many stars can mount and ride horses like professionals.</p><p class=p1>“I actually started showing under a secret name,” <a href=#><strong>Kaley Cuoco</strong> </a>revealed during a September 2016 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;</i></a>of her <a href=#>then-newfound equestrian pursuits</a>. “I have a little bit of an alias. I’ve been trying to steer clear of being super noticeable but it’s hard when you’re being followed around. … I just tried to come up with something simple because it’s always up on a big board so people walk by and they see the name.”</p><p class=p1>She added: “The problem is too in the horse world, a lot of people know what horses you ride and the names of them. My horses are becoming a little more famous than I am.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Flight Attendant&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>has an expansive menagerie of animal companions</a>, including multiple dogs and equines.</p><p class=p1>“I have six horses, and they have been the biggest blessing in my life,” Cuoco told host <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> </a>at the time. “Horseback riding <a href=#>is why I’m so centered</a>, especially in this business. I wouldn’t have my career without it.”</p><p class=p1>Jenner, for her part, <a href=#>has been riding horses since childhood</a> and still frequently finds time to connect with her four-legged companions. “Big snuggles,” the <i><a href=#>Kardashians</a>&nbsp;</i>star captioned an August 2022 <a href=#>Instagram</a> snap with her brown pony.</p><p class=p1>“I remember being like, I’m not even kidding I think I was like 3 or 4, when [I started riding],” Jenner told <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> during an April 2019 interview for her sister’s <a href=#>Poosh</a> blog. “We lived in that house in El Dorado and in Hidden Hills [neighborhood,] [it is] a horse community.”</p><p class=p1>While living with her famous family, the supermodel soon “fell in love with horses” after being around their neighbors’ stallions.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I remember asking Mom and Dad to like take me to get lessons and they found a place called Fox Field which is led next to Sherwood,” Jenner added, referring to parents <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong></a>. “[I’d ride] sometimes multiple times a day. I would go every day after school and then when it was summertime, there was a woman that worked in Hidden Hills, and I would go all day long from 8 am to 8 pm and I would ride every single one of the horses. She probably had like 13 to 15 horses, and I would ride every single one for her.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to see photos of stars and their horses:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqyZmsBuvsidoKefXZ28s7%2FErGRraGFpf3SBjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
