In Heartstopper, Imogen looks for ways to flirt with Nick, unaware of his growing feelings for Charlie.</p><p id=par-4_67>Imogen does not come off as “evil” and is a sweet and bubbly girl. When she convinces Nick to go on a date, he ditches her to attend Charlie’s birthday party. He soon tells the truth about his crush on Charlie, and Imogen is understanding and supports him. She even becomes part of Charlie’s friend group and explains she is an “ally” to their love story.</p><p id=par-5_51>Fans of the Netflix series will be surprised to learn that Imogen does not exist in <a href=#>the original graphic novels. </a>Speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello!</a>, Oseman explains she wanted Imogen to be Nick’s friend who was not “one of the lads.” She also explains Imogen added the needed sprinkle of drama for Heartstopper.</p><h2>Fans want to see Imogen find her own love and a girlfriend in ‘Heartstopper’ Season 2</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Heartstopper fans, say hello to two brand new characters that Alice Oseman created for the series! ?</p><p>Imogen (played by Rhea Norwood) and Isaac (played by Tobie Donovan) ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Bblxl4BZB5</a></p>— Netflix (@netflix) <a href=#>April 8, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-6_49>Imogen not being in the original novels is one of the <a href=#>discrepancies between the series</a>.
