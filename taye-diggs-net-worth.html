Though he spent some time singing earlier in his career, Taye has dedicated most of his work to acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From musical productions to reality shows to TV series, Taye's been busy over the years. And his long resume in Hollywood is how he's amassed a $14 million net worth.</p><p>But there's one surprising gig that seems to make up most of his acting resume and his pocketbook. So what's Taye Diggs' net worth, and how did he earn it?</p><h2 id=what-is-taye-diggs-net-worth>What Is Taye Diggs' Net Worth?</h2><p>Most sources suggest that Taye Diggs' net worth is around $14 million. Of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">some sources</a> suggest it's a bit higher, at $16M. But hey, what's $2M when an actor/singer is as rich as Taye? For a '90s star who's still relevant today, it's an impressive figure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's even more impressive is Diggs' relative lack of scandals despite his climbing the millionaire ladder. He&nbsp;has dated a reality star, though; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and 'Selling Sunset' star Amanza Smith dated for about five years</a>, though they've since broken up.</p><h2 id=how-did-taye-diggs-make-14-million>How Did Taye Diggs Make $14 Million?</h2><p>Though Taye has been consistent in Hollywood over the years, he hasn't been the face of any blockbusters like other industry superstars. Instead of high-profile franchises, Taye seems to stick with smaller projects that speak to him in some way.</p><p>That doesn't mean he isn't having fun earning his money, though; Taye's been in a handful of comedies (romantic and otherwise), and he's also had some longer runs on TV series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Here's Why Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible Franchise Could Be Cursed" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible Franchise Could Be Cursed</a></span></p><p>In fact, one TV series is probably the reason for the bulk of Diggs' net worth; 'Private Practice.' Taye spent 111 episodes playing Dr. Sam Bennett, and he earned multiple awards for the performance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's likely that Taye's regular day job on that and other TV series carry the bulk of his income, while smaller gigs on 'Sesame Street' and 'Muppets Now' are more for fun than anything else.</p><h2 id=what-is-taye-diggs-doing-now>What Is Taye Diggs Doing Now?</h2><p>As of 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taye Diggs has been a regular on 'All American,'</a> though his reasons for joining the cast weren't fame or fortune. He does choose his projects carefully, and he seems to favor gigs that combine acting and singing (like the musical 'Rent').</p><p>But Diggs has also created a dance company, voiced animated characters, and acted on some kids' shows (he&nbsp;does have a son with Idina Menzel). His diverse portfolio is likely what will help his net worth continue to grow, even if his fame originated in the '90s.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="What Has Idina Menzel Been Up To Since 'Frozen'?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Idina Menzel Been Up To Since 'Frozen'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGVYrGqs8asZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
