There has always been a mutual respect between the two, with <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Latto even once citing an old Cardi performance as the sole inspiration behind her own shows</a>.</p><p>“I did Rolling Loud Miami in 2018ish…I was one of the openers,” Latto said in a 2022 interview with Audacy. “It was 3 p.m. hot as hell and I waited all the way to the end for Cardi B to perform and I stuck around in the hot sun and I was like ‘nah, I gotta see Cardi perform,’ and I just seen her like put on a show. Like, it was actual entertainment. Dancers, choreography.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/latto-big-energy-was-originally-supposed-to-be-for-cardi-b-250x142.jpg alt="Latto’s ‘Big Energy’ Was Originally Supposed To Be For Cardi B" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Latto’s ‘Big Energy’ Was Originally Supposed To Be For Cardi B</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 18, 2023</p></a><p>She continued, “She really had me entertained to where I wasn’t caring about the heat or standing on my feet all day. I was entertained. So I took that and ran with it like ‘you know what? I wanna put on a show too.’”</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Latto also shared a few lessons she’s learned since her explosive rise to fame.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>“I’ve learned to not be so hard on myself,” she said. “I second guess everything and the songs that I second-guessed or the lines that I second-guessed, people love ’em. So it’s like, don’t be so hard on yourself. It’s still fun…I get to wake up and do what I wanna do and create whatever’s on my mind. That’s fun, that’s the beauty in it. So don’t let it become a job.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mijmqykpHqkrdGdoGaaXaXCtXnIrWSopl2Zrm6yy6imq2WimrqqxA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
