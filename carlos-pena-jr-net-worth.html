He is best known for being not only an American singer, songwriter, rap musician, but a dancer and actor, who is known to the world as Carlos Garcia in THE TV series called “Big Time Rush”, and a member of the boy band with the same name. He is also recognized as a television director. His career has been active since 2004.</p><p>Sources estimate that Pena’s net worth is $4 million as of late 2015, with the main source of this amount of money being his acting career. Additionally to this, Pena has appeared in various advertisements and these have also added to his net worth. Another source of his wealth is coming from his dancing and singing career.</p><h3>Carlos Pena, Jr. Net Worth $4 Million</h3><p>Carlos Pena was raised in Weston, Florina, in a big family, by his father Carlos Pena, Sr. and his mother Margarita Pena. He was a student at Sagemont Upper School in Weston. Side by side with his education, he started earning money by doing performances in local musical productions such as “Grease”, and “Man of La Mancha”. He also starred in “Titanic”, a production by the American Heritage School. This had a huge influence in encouraging him to focus on an acting career, so he moved to Los Angeles in order to continue pursuing this goal.</p><p>When he was just 15 years old, his professional acting career began thanks to his first substantial appearance, in the TV drama series called “E.R” in the role of Arlo Escobar. Later, he had more guest-starring roles in other TV shows such as “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide” (2004-2005) playing King Bee, “Judging Amy” (2005) in the role of Diego Valdesera, “Summerland” (2005) as Student, as well as appearing in a number of the Super Soaker television commercials for the water gun toy. Soon after, he had a role in the “Little Shop of Horrors” musical, which brought him a nomination for Lead Actor in a Musical.</p><p>In 2007, he became a competitor in the MTV reality series named “Making Menudo”.</p><p>While Pena was studying musical theater at the Boston Conservatory, his manager called him to audition for a new Disney TV show called “Big Time Rush”, on the channel Nickelodeon, created by Scott Fellows. At the audition Pena won the main role of Carlos Garcia, so he moved to Hollywood in the same year. This TV show focuses on the Hollywood misadventures of Logan, Kendall, Carlos and James, four hockey players from Minnesota, after they are selected to form a boy band with the same name – “Big Time Rush”, also known as “BTR”. This pop boy band signed a contract with Nick Records, and later with Columbia Record, and their first single was performed in the first episode of the show. The band has released three albums as of late 2015: “BTR”, “Elevate” and “24/Seven”.</p><p>In the same year, he released his first single in the Spanish language called “Electrico”. Later in 2015, he competed in the TV show “Dancing with the Stars” and finished in fourth place. He is also recognized as the host of the Nickelodeon game show called “Webheads”.</p><p>Carlos Pena has been married to Alexa Vega, a famous actress, since the 4th January 2014. The couple still has no children. One of Pena’s biggest passions and hobbies is scuba diving, so he is a certified rescue diver. He likes Taekwondo, too, and has a black belt.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>2.9 million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 15, 1989</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Columbia, Missouri, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>102 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Dancer, Singer-songwriter, Television Director</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Northeastern University, Haverhill High School, Wright State University, Boston Conservatory, Sagemont School, Boston Conservatory, Sagemont School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Alexa Vega (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Margarita Pena, Carlos Pena, Sr., Margarita Pena, Carlos Pena, Sr., Carlos Pena, Sr., Margarita Pena</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Andres Pena, Antonio Pena, Javi Pena, Andres Pena, Antonio Pena, Javi Pena, Andres Pena, Antonio Pena, Javi Pena</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Carlos Pena Jr. , Carlos Roberto Pena, Jr. , Carlos Pena , Carlos Roberto Pena , Big Time Rush , Los , CP , Carlitos , The Conflect , The Conflict</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>http://www.facebook.com/TheRealCarlosPenaVega%20http://www.facebook.com/TheRealCarlosPenaVega%20</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>http://www.twitter.com/thecarlospena</a></td></tr><tr><td>Google+</td><td>http://plus.google.com/101697262489374494688</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>http://www.instagram.com/therealcarlospenahttp://www.instagram.com/therealcarlospena</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm1821327</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Silver Slugger Award</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Big Time Rush, Big Time Rush</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite TV Actor, Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite TV Actor, Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite TV Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Grease: Live, Spare Parts, Code Academy, Big Time Movie, Little Birds, Grease: Live, Spare Parts, Code Academy, Big Time Movie, Little Birds, Grease: Live, Spare Parts, Code Academy, Big Time Movie, Little Birds</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Big Time Rush, Dancing with the Stars, Big Time Rush, Dancing with the Stars, Big Time Rush, Dancing with the Stars</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Became a father for the 1st time at age 27 when his wife Alexa PenaVega gave birth to their son Ocean King PenaVega on December 7, 2016.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Carlos’s Favorite Thing To Do On A Cruise Ship Is To Go On The Flo Rider.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Best Friends George Kosturs & Nic Luken.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Carlos has 2 cats – Zero & Zira.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>His father is of Spanish and Venezuelan descent.
