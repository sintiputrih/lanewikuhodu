Our aim was to allow them to create an image that reflects the way the subjects see themselves. And the way they want to be seen.”</p><p>For the themed issue, self-proclaimed selfie queen Kardashian, 34, poses topless in bed, showing off her ample cleavage.</p><p>In her self-portrait, a gorgeous Lopez, 46, wears a body-hugging black leotard that accentuates her coveted curves.
