A rep for the singer confirms to <i>Us Weekly</i> exclusively that the couple welcomed a son, Besso, on June 17.</p><p>The baby, who weighed 7 lbs and 2 oz at birth, is the first for the couple. Harper also shares son Ellery and daughter Jaya with ex <b>Laura Dern </b>as well as daughter Harris and son Charles with ex <b>Joanna Harper.</b></p><p><i></i><a href=#><i>Us Weekly </i>exclusively confirmed</a> in March that the couple, who secretly wed on New Year’s Day in 2015, were expecting. Harper told <i>Us</i> in 2014 that he was already dreaming of expanding his family with his then-girlfriend. “Look at this woman!” Harper told <i>Us </i>at the time. “How could I not?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Steal My Kisses” singer opened up about his musical influence on his kids during an interview with <a href=#>fatherly.com</a> in 2015. “Their first songs were when they were in the womb — I played music for them in utero,” he said at the time. “I kind of wonder if I played it too loud, developing ear drums and that stuff, because I put the speaker right up to the stomach and let rip with everything from <b>Stevie Wonder</b> to <b>Bob Marley</b> to <b>Bob Dylan</b> to A Tribe Called Quest. I’d be hard-pressed to give an honest answer to what their first songs were after they were born, because there was just always something on the turntable.Music is the daily diet, so I didn’t specifically say, ‘OK, this is the first song.’ Maybe I should have.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnZ5itaK%2Bz56pZqKRmLm6uoymmK2epah6uLHLnKamnV2WerS7zWaubmhkZ39zew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestDash - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
